## Overview

#### Admission to Year 1 – Direct School Admission (DSA)  

Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).  

Primary 6 (P6) students who do not participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE results through the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.  

Female Singaporean, Singapore PR and International Students who possess talents and achievements in a specific academic subject, a sport, music, visual art or demonstrate leadership in serving the school/community  are encouraged to apply for admission to RGS from May to June annually.
