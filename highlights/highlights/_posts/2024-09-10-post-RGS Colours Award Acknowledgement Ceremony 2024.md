<p>The 2024 RGS Colours Award Acknowledgement Ceremony was recently held
during Hall Assembly, a special occasion where our school community came
together to recognise and celebrate the contributions and achievements
of our students in their respective CCAs and Leadership Boards.
<br>
<br>During the ceremony, students from the Cogitare Club and Ethnic Dance
shared their good practices on collaboration, highlighting how they work
with students from other schools and beyond the RGS community. These collaborations,
centred around shared interests, have allowed them to forge new friendships
and gain enriching experiences, fostering an open mindset and a deep appreciation
for diversity.
<br>
<br>Congratulations to all the recipients!</p>
