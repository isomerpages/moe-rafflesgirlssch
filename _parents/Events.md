## Events

PRGS’s events provide a great opportunity for parents/guardians to network and have a better understanding of the school and their child’s/ward’s student life. Talks and workshops organised by PRGS for parents/guardians provide insights into certain topics which may be relevant to parents/guardians, while the signature “Breakfast Dialogues with Principals” allows parents/guardians to have discussions with the school leadership in a small-group setting.  

Other initiatives include the Year One Parents Orientation,
Year One School Parent Meeting, Y4 girls’
transition to RI talk and the PRGS
Awards presented to deserving students on
Founder’s Day. 

At practically every major school
event, where their presence made a difference,
the PRGS Association members contributed
wholeheartedly – Sports Fest, Racial Harmony
Day, Staff Appreciation Day, and Farewell Alma
Mater, just to name a few.
