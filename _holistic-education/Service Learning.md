## Service-Learning

<img src="/images/Service Learning.jpg" style="width:49%" align="right">

The RGS Service-Learning programme seeks to nurture our students to be socially responsible individuals through the provision of opportunities to perform meaningful community service. It is carried out across their four years in RGS and is embedded in the Character and Leadership Education programme. Through service-learning, our students actively engage in enhancing the well-being of the local community and grow to become independent, pro-active learners. They are equipped and empowered to serve, explore and act on real community needs. This includes the Overseas Service-Learning programme for selected students and civic engagement projects through the Community Problem Solving programme.

Based on \*Treffinger’s Levels of Service (LoS), service learning in RGS is designed to provide for the different profiles of our students, who will complete a Community Exploration project by the time they are in Year 2. With this foundation, our students can make informed choices and pursue Community Action projects or continue with Community Service/Exploration projects when they are in Year 3 and Year 4.

## Community Problem Solving (CmPS) Programme in RGS

The Community Problem Solving (CmPS) Programme is a differentiated programme for students with a strong passion for service and want to advocate on social issues in the community. Working in teams of about six to eight members, students use problem-solving skills to address real-world problems. They identify a community area of concern, explore challenges, establish an underlying problem, propose an action plan and carry out proposed solutions (partnering stakeholders) to address the issue at hand. Students then reflect on their experience so they can build on these experiences in other service-learning projects.

Some examples of CmPS projects include: inspiring children to pursue STEM careers, educating and working with students to build proper posture, equipping seniors to become competent technology users and advocating the importance of coral reefs on our ecosystem.

## Values-in-Action (VIA)

As a school that seeks to develop the aspiration and capacity for service to nation and community in every student, the RGS Values-in-Action (VIA) programme provides enriched and differentiated experiences within a vibrant environment of stewardship and service. The programme seeks to build in each student, the capacity to advocate by deepening their understanding of and responsibility in addressing community issues. We aim to enable each student entering RGS, with different strengths and aptitude towards service, the opportunity to discover her passions and develop according to her level of readiness.

## Student-Initiated Values-in-Action Projects (SVIA)

Some examples of SVIA projects include: advocating for animal welfare and environment conservation, reading and academic support programmes, student advocacy for individuals with special needs, developing children’s interest in STEM, and many more…
