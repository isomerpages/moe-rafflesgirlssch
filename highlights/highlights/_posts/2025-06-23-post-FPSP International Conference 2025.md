<p>In June 2025, a group of RGS students represented Singapore at the Future
Problem Solving Programme (FPSP) International Conference held at Indiana
University Bloomington.</p>

<p>Among the participants was Pan Yu Hui from the Community Problem Solving
(CmPS) team, <em>Project Oculus</em>, who shared:</p>
<p>PSPIC was an event my team and I had highly anticipated, and the experience
proved to be as enriching and memorable as we had hoped. This was thanks
to two key elements: the programme itself and the people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was greatly inspired by the programme -- its mission to nurture future
problem-solvers and bring together like-minded youths was deeply inspiring.
I particularly appreciate the opportunity to learn from innovative projects
from around the world, which showed me what youths like ourselves can do
when we channel our creativity and passion into meaningful action.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond the program, it was the people who made this experience truly unforgettable.
My team and I bonded as we worked and learned together, being side by side
24/7 and enjoying the "university dorm life" for a week. Although we faced
challenges, they taught us the importance of teamwork and communication.
In addition, we enjoyed meeting diverse and driven individuals from around
the world. We shared precious moments -- from exchanging gifts and filming
social media clips, to learning from each other and sharing our passions.</p>
<p>Overall, FPSPIC was more than just enjoyable — it was eye-opening, transformative
and pushed me beyond my comfort zone. None of it would have been possible
without those who supported us: FPS for such a meaningful programme, our
school, teachers and mentors for their unwavering guidance, as well as
my amazing teammates and the entire Singapore delegation. I am extremely
grateful and humbled to be part of this programme.</p>

<p>Year 3 student Cai Yizhen, who participated in the <em>Global Issues Problem Solving (GIPS)</em> component,
reflected on the intensity and impact of the competition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The experience was truly an incredible one shaped by the people we met,
the challenges we faced, and the growth we experienced together.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Global Issues Problem Solving (GIPS), the competition consists of
an intensive two-hour booklet round, where students must tackle a future
scene using the six-step problem-solving process. This is followed by an
action plan presentation, which requires teams to creatively perform a
skit to present their final solution.</p>
<p>During the booklet competition, we were completely taken aback by the
future scene provided, as it was unlike anything we had anticipated or
prepared for—deviating significantly from the typical scenarios we had
practised before the event. Nevertheless, our team remained calm, worked
together to organise our thoughts, and quickly developed a strategy to
approach the task. Thankfully, we managed to apply our prior research and
ideas effectively, which earned us 3rd place in the Middle Division GIPS
Team competition.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One key takeaway from this competition is the importance of staying calm
and adaptable under pressure. Being able to think on our feet and trust
in our teamwork made a significant difference. We learned that even when
things do not go according to plan, a flexible mindset and clear communication
can help steer the team in the right direction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I believe that the six-step problem-solving process is not
only useful during the competition but is also applicable to real-life
situations. Gaining a deeper understanding of this method has undoubtedly
enhanced both my critical and creative thinking skills.</p>
<p>Beyond the competition, IC was a vibrant and enriching experience that
allowed us to connect with like-minded individuals from all over the world.
Through activities such as the Memento Exchange (a trading and gift exchange
event), the Variety Show, and the Dance (a social event), we had the opportunity
to learn about the diverse cultures of different countries and states.
Among the two GIPS middle teams, we built strong connections with a group
from Texas and a few Australian participants, and we even performed a dance
together at the Variety Show. These friendships are truly invaluable.</p>
<p>Lastly, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to our coaches,
Mr Lim Er Yang and Mr Faizal, for their unwavering guidance and encouragement;
to my teammates—Ashley, Chelsea, and Yilin—for sharing those intense cognitive
battles; and to the other middle team, the senior team, and our teachers
for their tips and constant support.</p>
<p>This journey was not just about completing or winning a competition. Instead,
it was about the growth we experienced together, and the connections and
camaraderie we built with fellow passionate individuals.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for the opportunity to represent RGS and Singapore
at the International Conference."</p>
