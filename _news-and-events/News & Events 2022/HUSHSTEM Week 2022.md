## HUSH-STEM Week 2022

HUSH-STEM Week 2022 was held from 11-14 April, and the RGS community was able to participate in a series of activities and workshops that explore the sub theme of the event - Responsible Consumption and Production - UN SD Goal 12. The theme is aligned to the national and global focus of coming up with recovery plans following the COVID-19 pandemic to reverse trends and change our consumption and production patterns towards a more sustainable future.  
  
Jointly organised by the RGS Science and Humanities departments, with some of the workshops led by our very own student groups such as the Cogitare Club and the Maker's Club interest group, the activities include a series of Experiential Studios where students and staff could try their 'green' hands at gardening, learn the art of fermentation while making kimchi, or create their own music boxes and more! Delegates at a Model UN EcoSoc Council had the opportunity to share their innovative solutions on sustainable consumption and production, while representatives from each of the five RGS Houses also competed in an Inter-House Game where they were required to build a prototype of their solution for sustainable consumption in our canteen.  
  
For the first time, the organising team also partnered the school's Canteen Committee and the canteen vendors to bring in plant-based delights and whipped up delectable menu items that both students and staff were able to enjoy!

Held annually, HUSH-STEM Week at RGS aims to enable students to understand the multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary nature of STEM disciplines in the real world, as well as to develop greater civic-consciousness in the local and global context.
