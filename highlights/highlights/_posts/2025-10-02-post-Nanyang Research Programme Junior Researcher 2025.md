<p>This year, eight RGS students embarked on an eight-month research journey
from April to December 2024. Their efforts culminated in the submission
of a research paper and an oral presentation, where they achieved outstanding
results, with one team attaining the Platinum Award, two teams receiving
Gold Awards, and one team earning a Silver Award.</p>

<h4><strong>Student Reflection:</strong></h4>
<p>“<em>My NRPjr journey investigating the cultural elements in Singapore’s Chinese textbooks showed me how much there is to learn beyond the classroom and the joy of using research to push the barrier of knowledge further. I found it meaningful to move from simply reading textbooks to noticing the intention behind each detail and appreciating how these choices shape how culture is conveyed to students, while also learning to question and refine ideas through research</em>.”
