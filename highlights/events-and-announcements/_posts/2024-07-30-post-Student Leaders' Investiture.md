<p>Our Year 3 student leaders were officially invested into their new leadership
roles at the annual Student Leadersâ€™ Investiture. We were delighted to
have Ms Serene Tan-Johnson (Class of 1997) grace the event.</p>
<p>The theme for this year's investiture echoes our school theme, "One Heart,
One Voice," representing the commitment to unity, collaboration, and collective
action among student leaders.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our newly-minted student leaders! Embrace your
roles with enthusiasm and dedication, knowing that you have the power to
make a positive impact. To all our outgoing student leaders, thank you
for your dedication and service!</p>
