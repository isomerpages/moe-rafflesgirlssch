## National Creative Story Writing Competition

Congratulations to RGS alumna Cao Yuqing (class of 2019) for winning the Excellence Award for her story 《满天星，而不是玫瑰》for the National Creative Story Writing Competition 2019. Yuqing is one of 36 students nation-wide recognised for their creativity and writing skills during the virtual prize presentation ceremony last weekend (10 October 2020).  
  
The competition is jointly organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning and the Singapore Centre for Chinese Language (SCCL), and aims to instill in students an interest in the Chinese language, and produce local reading materials for secondary students. The competition saw the submission of around 400 entries for both the Student Category (for students from secondary schools, junior colleges and Millennia Institute) and the Open Category (for Singaporeans and Permanent Residents).  
  
The winning entries from the competition have also been published as a set of eight Chinese Graded Readers by the NTU-SCCL Press under SCCL, which was launched by Minister of State for Education, Ms Sun Xueling at the virtual prize presentation ceremony. The Readers are designed to be used as supplementary reading materials for secondary students, and features original illustrations by local artists. The Readers will be distributed free to all secondary schools in January 2021.
