<p>As part of the History Talent Development Programme at Raffles Girls’
School (RGS), our Year 2 students participated in the Historical Scene
Investigation (HSI) Challenge 2024, an annual competition organised by
the National Library Board (NLB) and supported by the Ministry of Education’s
(MOE) History Unit. This contest offers students the opportunity to showcase
their historical inquiry and research skills through creative storytelling
and thoughtful investigation.</p>

<p>This year’s competition featured 117 participating schools, including
RGS. Students explored post-independence policies in Singapore from 1965
to 1979, focusing on how these policies shaped the lives of Singaporeans
at the time and their continued impact today.</p>
<p>RGS Team 1&nbsp;secured&nbsp;1st place&nbsp;and earned a&nbsp;Gold Level
Certification! Additionally, RGS&nbsp;Team 2&nbsp;delivered a strong performance
and earned a&nbsp;Silver Level Certification.</p>
