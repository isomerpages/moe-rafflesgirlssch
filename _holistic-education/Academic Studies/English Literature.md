<h2>English Literature</h2>
<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
<p>Literature, rooted in life and centuries of human experience, is a mode
of creative expression that engages the reader in the aesthetic domain.
The literary tradition, an invaluable and ever-growing resource, gives
access to the very best in human thought and culture. The study of literature
thus enables the reader to critically examine human experience that leads
to greater self-awareness. It provokes thinking about our beliefs and values
and invites a personal engagement with ideas in the aesthetic domain. An
appreciation of Literature will enhance one’s sensitivity to the power
of words and thus, the importance of using them critically and creatively
to serve society, making the world a more humane and beautiful place.</p>
