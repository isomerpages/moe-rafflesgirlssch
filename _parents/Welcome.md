<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>RGS is blessed with wonderful parents who are strong advocates of partnership
between parents and the school. The Parents for RGS Association (PRGS)
is a registered society established since 26 February 2003, although the
parents' volunteer group at RGS has been active for more than a decade
before that.</p>
<p>PRGS works closely with the school to provide a support network for parents/guardians
of RGS students, and organise activities to allow our members to develop
and maintain links with the school. This legacy of close partnership and
collaboration between PRGS and the school has enabled us to tap on the
skills and expertise of these parents to provide a rich school experience
for our girls.</p>
<p>We are looking for Exco members for 2024 and adhoc volunteers! If you
would like to play an active and involved role in PRGSâ€™s events and activities,
