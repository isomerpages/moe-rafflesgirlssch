## Global Youth Science and Technology Bowl (GYSTB)

The Global Youth Science and Technology Bowl (GYSTB) is an international student science project competition in biology, chemistry, physics and engineering, organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups. 

The competition is a showcase of global youth scientific achievement and innovation, which aims to promote science and technology. In addition, this competition aims to provide a platform for global youth to develop their creativity and scientific mindsets, and facilitate the exchange of scientific ideas, interests and abilities among young scientists all over the world. 

In this year's edition of the competition, a project from RGS was one of five projects selected during the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair by MOE to represent Singapore. It was a project that the students worked on under Research@YDSP while they were in Y4 in RGS in 2020.

We are proud to announce that the team performed very well and attained the Grand Prize - Bronze Award!
