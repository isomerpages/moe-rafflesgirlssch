<p>This event, organised by the School of Management and Communication’s
Diploma in Mass Communication (DMC), provided an invaluable platform for
media-savvy secondary school students to explore their passion for digital
media.</p>
<p>With participation from 16 secondary schools and a total of 21 teams,
our students showcased their skills and creativity in mass communication.
Working collaboratively, they crafted integrated content packages focused
on raising awareness about mental wellness among Singaporean youths. Through
hands-on workshops led by media industry practitioners and DMC lecturers,
our students gained valuable insights and tips, enhancing their understanding
of digital media strategies.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the competition was the opportunity for our students
to pitch their media packages to a panel of judges comprising industry
experts and DMC lecturers. This experience not only provided them with
constructive feedback but also honed their presentation skills.</p>
<p>In recognition of World Mental Health Day on 10 October, McDonald’s Singapore
announced the launch of its new youth mental wellness initiative, ‘Lovin’
Me,’ a comprehensive campaign designed to support the emotional well-being
of young Singaporeans.</p>
<p>The ‘Lovin’ Me’ campaign, featured a carefully crafted integrated content
package that focused on raising awareness about mental wellness among Singaporean
youths.</p>
<p>These included ideas that were pitched by our RGS girls during their participation
in Republic Polytechnic’s (RP) The Media Challenge.</p>

passion will take them in the future.</p>
