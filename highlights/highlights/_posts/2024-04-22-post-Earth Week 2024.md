<p><strong>RGS&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;Week&nbsp;2024!</strong>
</p>
<p>In the lead-up to&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;Day, members of the Cogitare club organised
a series of activities to raise awareness about environmental issues and
to promote sustainability.</p>
<p>Themed “Our Path to a Greener Tomorrow,”&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;Week&nbsp;began
with a special hall assembly programme&nbsp;featuring an engaging and informative
skit by Cogitare Club members on a Greener Tomorrow. We were also delighted
to have a special presentation by environmentalist Ms Kong Man Jing, who
shared&nbsp;deep&nbsp;insights on the impact of climate change in Singapore
and around the world. Ms Kong also proposed ways in which all of us can
play a role in mitigating climate change and&nbsp;collectively contribute
positively to environmental conservation efforts.</p>
<p>During the&nbsp;week, various&nbsp;Student Initiated Values-in-Action
(SVIA) and Community Problem Solving (CmPS) teams put together an informative
exhibition showcasing their initiatives and&nbsp;the steps they have taken
in shaping a greener future for Singapore.&nbsp;We concluded the&nbsp;week&nbsp;with
a special&nbsp;workshop, a collaboration with&nbsp;students from Guanyang
Secondary School. The hands-on workshop allowed participants to make&nbsp;not
only their very own mousetrap car,&nbsp;but also to&nbsp;explore the unique
biodiversity around our Braddell Campus!&nbsp;This certainly made the learning
experience engaging and memorable.</p>
<p>Inspired by the activities during&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;Week, let’s continue&nbsp;practising&nbsp;sustainability
every day and together, let's protect our precious&nbsp;Earth&nbsp;for
generations to come!</p>
