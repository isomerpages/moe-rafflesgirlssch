## SMRT-PSB Kindness Initiative 2022

On 27 May 2022, our students from the RGS Peer Support Board presented Braddell MRTâ€™s Station Manager, Mr Omar with a set of specially-designed Appreciation Boards. The boards were filled with handwritten appreciation notes to the SMRT staff from the RGS Community.  
  
Thank you to SMRT for all your hard work towards ensuring that we have a safe, smooth and pleasant journey!
