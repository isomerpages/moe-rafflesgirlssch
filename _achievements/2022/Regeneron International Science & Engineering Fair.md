## Regeneron International Science & Engineering Fair

Congratulations to Annika Liu Xinan from the class of 2020 for achieving the 4th Award in the Chemistry category of the Regeneron International Science & Engineering Fair 2022 (ISEF)!  
  
Her project, ‘Go Mini or Go Home! Fabrication and Evaluation of Miniature Solid-State Ion-Selective Electrodes for pH Measurement’ was one of two RGS projects selected during the Singapore Science & Engineering Fair to represent Singapore at the Regeneron ISEF. Glenda Tan Hui En and Koay Tze Erhn from the class of 2020 also represented Singapore at the fair with their project ‘Anti-virus Autobots: Predicting More Infectious Virus Variants for Pandemic Prevention through Deep Learning’.
