#### A) English Language and Literature

In RGS, the English Language and Literature disciplines are closely intertwined, offering students rich and rigorous engagement with the written and spoken word. Through the study of the English Language, students develop an appreciation of language as a powerful medium for thought, communication, and reflection. Our curriculum aims to nurture informed individuals who can engage thoughtfully with moral, social, and philosophical issues, and equip them to be articulate advocates and leaders in an increasingly complex world.

The study of Literature, grounded in centuries of human experience, invites students into the world of fiction, where they encounter diverse perspectives and timeless ideas. Literature fosters critical thinking, empathy, and self-awareness, encouraging students to reflect deeply on the human condition and their own values and beliefs. Through personal engagement with texts, students develop a sensitivity to the power of language to shape individual thought, influence society and inspire change.&nbsp;

Together, English Language and Literature cultivate thoughtful communicators and discerning readers who are empowered to contribute meaningfully to the world around them.

#### B) English Language Talent Development Programme

At RGS, we believe in nurturing voices that will shape the future. The English Language and Literature Department empowers young writers, speakers, playwrights, producers, and performers to explore their passions, refine their craft, and find their purpose.

Our Talent Development Map charts our students’ journeys of discovery. They will be guided by dedicated mentors and their learning will be enriched by their interactions with leading writers and artists. Our talents actively lead initiatives that celebrate the written word, such as the student-run Raffles Gazette, and champion literacy through community projects that inspire a love for reading and writing in the young.

We aspire to cultivate pioneers — individuals who wield language with creativity, conviction, and a deep sense of service to humanity.
