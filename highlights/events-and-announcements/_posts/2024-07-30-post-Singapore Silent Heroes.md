<p>The Singapore Silent Heroes (SSH) Award Presentation is an annual ceremony
organised by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cas.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Civilians Association (Singapore)</a>&nbsp;(CAS).
The award recognises ordinary, everyday Singaporeans and permanent residents
for their extraordinary humanity and compassion towards people, causes,
and missions.</p>
<p>In 2023, CAS introduced the SSH Student Award to acknowledge local students
from various schools for their acts of kindness.</p>
<p>We are proud to announce that the following students have received the
award for their outstanding contributions during their student-initiated
project:</p>
