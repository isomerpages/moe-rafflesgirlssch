Introduced in 2010, the Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad (SJChO) is a competition organised by the Singapore National Institute of Chemistry (SNIC) in partnership with NUS, NTU, SUTD, IMRE and ISCE 2 and is supported by the Ministry of Education. This competition provides a platform for upper secondary students to challenge themselves in their chemical knowledge and skills.

Awards are given to top performing schools based on the total number of individual awards won. There are
three bands of top performing schools. At the 2023 SJChO, RGS performed admirably well and was placed in Band 3.
