<p>This year’s English Day and EL Week took on the theme Atrociously Yours,
English ✒️, a playful nod to our love hate relationship with the language
and all its quirks, from tricky grammar rules to borrowed words and new
expressions.</p>
<p>Dress Up Day brought the theme to life with ELEMENTAL WORDPLAY. From corny
unicorns to clever puns and elements straight out of the periodic table,
students showed just how creative language can be through their imaginative
costumes. Witty, whimsical and wonderfully atrocious, just the way we like
it!</p>
<p>Still in costume, our girls jumped straight into the fun with a range
of word based games. They tossed cubes of letters into the air and raced
to form words, acted out scenes from plays and poems, and tackled online
riddles and anagrams that tested their quick thinking, teamwork and vocabulary.</p>
<p>The week wrapped up with a lively workshop on How to Write a Fast, Fun
Story, where students became impromptu authors, crafting flash fiction
on the spot and discovering that writing can be just as playful as it is
powerful.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a week filled with words, laughter and creativity,
celebrating English in all its messy, meaningful glory.</p>
