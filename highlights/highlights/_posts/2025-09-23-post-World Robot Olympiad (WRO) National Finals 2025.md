<p>Our girls from the Robotics Club participated in the World Robot Olympiad
(WRO) National Finals, held from 10–13 September 2025 at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.
We are proud to share that one of our teams emerged champion in their category
and will be representing Singapore at the WRO World Finals later this year.</p>
<p>The World Robot Olympiad (WRO®) is a global robotics competition that
nurtures innovation, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills in youths.
By designing and programming robots to tackle real-world challenges, participants
gain hands-on STEM experience while preparing for future careers in technology
and engineering.</p>
<p>The team’s journey was marked by adaptability and perseverance. Confronted
with time and resource constraints, they refined their robot design and
learnt to think on their feet when addressing judges’ questions. Although
the first round did not go as planned, they pushed on with determination,
improving in subsequent rounds and proving that resilience is key to success.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the girls shared that their excitement getting to represent
Singapore on the world stage. Beyond the competition, they look forward
to forging new friendships with peers from other schools and countries
while deepening their passion for robotics and further honing their skills.</p>
