<p>This year, our students took part in the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine
Competition (SAFMC) under Category B – Unpowered Glider, where teams were
challenged to design and build small, bungee-launched gliders capable of
achieving both maximum flight distance and high accuracy. The category
emphasised not only flight performance but also creativity, presentation
skills, and thoughtful engineering grounded in physics principles.</p>
<p><em>Team Hurricane clinched the Best Presentation Award, presented to the team that demonstrates exceptional creativity, fluency, confidence, flair, and that unmistakable “wow” factor during their presentation and interview. Impressively, they also won the same award in 2024.</em>
