<p>The China Girls Mathematical Olympiad (CGMO) was first organised in 2002
to encourage the study of Mathematics in Greater China. Over the years,
the competition has expanded to include international teams. Each year,
top performing girls from Singapore schools go through a stringent selection&nbsp;process
to qualify for this competition, where only the best 4 girls are selected
each year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, 2 RGS students were selected to represent Singapore in this&nbsp;prestigious
competition. Wendy Leong (S401) and Luo Xindi (S312) achieved remarkable
success, with Xindi receiving the Silver Award, and Wendy being the first
Y4 RGS girl to receive the Gold Award.&nbsp;</p>

the first RGS student feels surreal. Beyond this, I forged friendships
with like-minded peers, which broadened my perspectives. Iâ€™m grateful for
the support from my teachers and friends, which fueled my growth and resilience.</div>
