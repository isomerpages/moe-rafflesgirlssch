<p>In a sea of red and white, the entire Rafflesian family gathered as ONE
to celebrate Singapore’s 59th birthday!</p>
<p>The celebration commenced with a ceremonial parade led by our uniformed
groups. We were honoured to have Mrs Susan Peh (Class of 1978), Co-Founder
and Chief Executive of Adsan Law, as our Guest-of-Honour. Representatives
from the Parents of RGS Association also joined us for the celebration.
The ceremonial parade culminated with the recital of our pledge in all
four official languages and the singing of our National Anthem.</p>
<p>The concert segment featured the popular “LoveSG” and Fashion Parade items.
The Year 4 classes put together creative and humorous skits that highlighted
their iteration of the Singapore Spirit. Similarly, the meticulously designed
Singapore-themed outfits by the Year 4 classes during the Fashion Parade
had everyone in awe! The concert segment culminated with the community
singing of our favourite National Day songs.</p>
<p>The celebration truly echoed this year’s National Day theme: “Together,
As One United People,” highlighting the collective strength of our nation
and the importance of rallying together to uplift one another.</p>
<p>Our heartfelt appreciation to all students, staff, parents, and alumnae
for your support and contributions towards this awesome celebration!</p>
<p>As our theme song beautifully reminds us, "If we just look to each other,
then this house will feel like home. And the more we’re together, the further
we’ll go. You and I, we're not alone." Together, as Singaporeans, we embrace
the spirit of unity and the promise of a brighter future!</p>
<p>Happy 59th Birthday Singapore!</p>
