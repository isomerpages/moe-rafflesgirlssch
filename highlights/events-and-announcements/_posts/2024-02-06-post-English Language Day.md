<p>As part of an annual RGS school event planned by the English Language
and Literature Department, RGS staff and students came dressed as characters
according to this year’s theme, ‘A Way With Adventure’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EL Day allows our students to immerse in the joy of the English Language
through reading, writing, appreciation, and play.&nbsp;Apart from dressing
up, students were encouraged to go on a ‘Blind Date with a Book’ - choosing
from an extensive collection&nbsp;(physical copies &amp; e-books)&nbsp;curated
by the RGS Library staff.</p>
