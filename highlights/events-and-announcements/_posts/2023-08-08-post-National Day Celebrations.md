##### **RGS Celebrates Singapore’s 58th Birthday!**

In a sea of red and white, the entire Rafflesian family gathered as ONE to celebrate Singapore's 58th birthday. The celebration commenced with a ceremonial parade led by our uniformed groups. We were honoured to have Justice Mavis Chionh, Chairperson of RGS Board of Governors, as our Guest-of-Honour. Representatives from the Parents of RGS Association also joined us for the celebration. The ceremonial parade culminated with the recital of our pledge in all four official languages and the singing of our National Anthem.

The concert segment featured the popular “LoveSG” and Fashion Parade items. The Year 4 classes put together creative and humorous skits,  that highlighted their iteration of the Singapore Spirit. Similarly, the meticulously designed Singapore-themed outfits by the Year 4 classes during the Fashion Parade had everyone in awe and sometimes, in stitches too! The concert segment culminated with the community singing of our favourite National Day songs.

The celebration truly echoed this year’s National Day theme, “Onward as One," which calls upon each and every one of us to look forward confidently and move onward together to build our shared future as one united people. A big Thank You to all students, staff, parents, and alumnae for your support and contributions towards this awesome celebration!
