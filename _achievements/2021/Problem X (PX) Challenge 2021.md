## Problem X (PX) Challenge 2021

Problem X (PX) Challenge is a programme jointly organised by the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). Incepted in 2020, the programme targets Year 2 to 4 students who demonstrate strong aptitude, passion and motivation for inquiry in Science and Mathematics.

PX Challenge 2021 took place virtually in lieu of safe management measures. The focus for problem-solving this year was environmental waste in Singapore, due to the extensive use of plastic cutlery. Working on the given real-world problem, students had to seek possible “solutions” for it by considering different perspectives and leveraging their knowledge of different disciplines, particularly in Science and Mathematics.

RGS registered 29 teams for the competition, of which 2 were shortlisted for the finals. Under the guidance of RGS teacher-mentors, the RGS teams emerged as Champion and 2nd Runner Up. 4 teams also received special awards for their projects:
