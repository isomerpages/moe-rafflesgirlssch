<p>The Singapore International Band Festival (SIBF) is a biennial event established
in 2008 by the Wind Bands Association of Singapore. SIBF has gained a reputation
as a premier international platform in Asia, offering developmental opportunities
for bands and maintaining high artistic integrity in its adjudication.</p>
<p>Through SIBF, wind bands and ensembles from around the world gather in
Singapore to exchange musical ideas and ideals. The festival encourages
musicians of all ages to continuously learn and strive for excellence at
their own pace.</p>
<p>Competing on an international level, our students from the RGS Symphonic
Band recently performed in Division 2A (aged 20 and below) despite being
in a challenge level above their age group. They distinguished themselves
among their fellow musicians, earning a Gold award for their performance.</p>
<p>Following the competition, our girls had the opportunity to attend a workshop
and masterclass with adjudicator Surapol Thanyawibool from Thailand, gaining
practical skills and insights into musical performance.</p>
<p>SIBF also fosters international exchange, allowing participants to meet
fellow musicians from diverse cultures, share musical experiences, and
build networks for future collaborations.</p>
