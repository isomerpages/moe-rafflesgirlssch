<h2>RGS Alumnae</h2>
<p>Registered as a society on 22 July 2014, the&nbsp;<a href="http://rgsalumnae.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">RGS Alumnae</a>&nbsp;(RGSA) seeks to connect
members with RGS girls to inspire, enable and engage these Daughters of
a Better Age across the years as ambassadors for education and egalitarianism.
<br>To that end, the RGSA has embarked on several initiatives to raise money
for the RGS New Campus Development Fund in preparation for RGS’ move to
its new Braddell campus. The RGSA also supports and promotes the growth
and development of RGS students through the RGS Alumnae Award, which is
awarded to two selected Year 3 students every year starting from 2015.
This award gives outstanding students a chance to receive personal career
mentoring and guidance from our alumnae based on their interests. To promote
interaction and allow former RGS girls to relive their school day memories
together, events such as Chic Chats are organised, which, as the name suggests,
allows them to catch up over drinks in a casual setting. Networking sessions
such as Straight Talk also provide opportunities for RGS girls to share
their career expertise and personal experiences.</p>
<p>These are some of the projects undertaken to promote RGSA as</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>a community embodying the Rafflesian spirit and values that provides mentoring
to students, teachers and fellow&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;members;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a collective that actively shares experiences and works toward the betterment
of society, nation and self; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a kindred commitment to shaping and achieving the goals of RGS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The RGS Alumnae will continue to provide a platform for alumnae to connect
with each other and with students of RGS, and will offer support to and
work with the School to promote and develop a community embodying the Rafflesian
spirit and values and contribute to shaping and achieving the goals of
RGS.</p>
