## FAQs

#### What are the education benefits of a 1:1 programme?

*   1:1 programmes extend learning beyond the classroom. With the ability to gather vast amounts of information from the Internet and new media, learning becomes multi-modal and more self-directed
*   Networking opportunities extend learning to include peers, parents, siblings and experts outside the school; making learning a collaborative experience while maintaining the individuality of each girl
*   Students who own their own ICT devices are found to take greater pride and ownership over the knowledge they create, with a flow-on to more flexible forms of schooling
*   Learning takes place anytime, anywhere
*   Students can learn experientially how the various disciplines use technology. Thinking like a scientist, for example, must include learning how technology is used to gather and analyse data

#### Will the use of ICT improve my daughter's academic results?

Research, including that of PISA 2015, has shown that there are modest gains in academic performance as a result of increased usage of ICT for teaching and learning. Given the profile of our students – highly-able and motivated – their academic results are not expected to improve solely because of increased ICT usage. What they will achieve is the ability to function in a world where technology plays a big part of everyday life.

#### How often will the device be used in class? Will it be used for all subjects?

All subject teachers are expected to use the device for teaching and learning. They are required to set learning tasks for at least 30% of curriculum hours. Usage is dependent on the nature of the subject. For example, students would use ICT less for PE than for Science.

#### How will the device be used during lessons?

The device will be used for

*   Creative expression
*   Establishing prior knowledge
*   Assessment - formative and summative
*   Research
*   Communication
*   Collaboration

#### Will my daughter be distracted from learning?

The school will do its best to monitor student usage to prevent abuse. Teachers in Years 1 and 2 will be using Apple Classroom to manage and monitor learning with the iPad while the students are in class. Every student will be informed about an Acceptable Use Policy. However, the school encourages personal responsibility and seeks the cooperation of parents in monitoring their children.

#### Will the use of ICT affect handwriting?

The need for students to write legibly will not be eliminated. Most assessments will still be pen-and-paper-based.

#### Will my daughter's eyesight be negatively affected through excessive use of the computer?

Students will not be working on the device throughout the day. They will be engaged in face-to-face interactions for most of the time during each lesson. Students will also be educated on the appropriate usage including ways of minimising negative effects on health.

#### How will the school ensure Internet safety?

While specific undesirable sites are blocked for Internet usage in school, Internet safety is a collaborative effort between students, teachers and parents. Teachers can monitor student activity during class time but usage in between lessons and after school would require onsite monitoring to ensure that students are mainly focused on learning while using their personal learning devices.

#### Is the charging of student iPad allowed in school?

As there are limited charging points in the classrooms and also charging stations in school, students are expected to come to school with a fully-charged iPad. Students are also expected to use their own charging cables at the charging stations in school. 

#### Do we have to buy the iPad, Apple Pencil and keyboard on our own?

MOE has managed to acquire a bundle deal for students' purchase. More information is available on the Year 1 Registration website (via our RGS iNet portal) on **22 December 2022**.

#### If we have an iPad and Apple Pencil but it is not the iPad (10th generation) and Apple Pencil (1st generation), do we need to buy?

There is no need to buy the iPad. As a device management application (DMA) will be installed onto the iPad, a factory reset must be done in preparation for the installation of the DMA. The factory reset will wipe out all the files on the iPad, hence, you must copy all your important files to an external storage and back-up your iPad to iCloud. The use of an Apple Pencil and keyboard is required.  
  
The use of an Apple Pencil (1st or 2nd generation) and physical keyboard is required.  
  
The older iPads that would be allowed are:  

*   iPad 8th generation (and later)
*   iPad Air (3rd generation and later)
*   iPad Pro 11-inch (all generations)
*   iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation and later)
