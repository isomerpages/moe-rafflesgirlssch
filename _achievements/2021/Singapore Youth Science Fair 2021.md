## Singapore Youth Science Fair 2021

This year is the fourth run of the newly launched new Singapore Youth Science Fair (SYSF). Started in 2014, SYSF is designed to promote Science education and attract mass participation of students at the Upper Primary and Lower Secondary levels. This celebration of Science learning is sponsored by Abbott Laboratories and co-organised by the Science Teachers Association of Singapore and Science Centre Singapore.

The theme for the 2021 Singapore Youth Science Fair is: Responsible Advocacy through Science
