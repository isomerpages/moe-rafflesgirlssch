## National School Games 2022

The National School Games (NSG), which runs from March to August this year, is the first time that student-athletes are able to fully participate in the NSG after it was disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic for the past two years.

Following the official launch of the games, RGS held our own symbolic ceremony on 12 April 2022 to commemorate the resumption of the NSG as well. Led by our 14 physical sports CCA representatives, our student-athletes recited the athletes' oath in front of their fellow schoolmates.  
  
We wish them all the best as they don their RGS jerseys with pride to compete in their various sports, igniting their spirits of competition and sportsmanship!  
  
Congratulations to our students-athletes, teachers and coaches for their following achievements from the NSG to date <u>(_caa 18 August 2022_)</u>:
