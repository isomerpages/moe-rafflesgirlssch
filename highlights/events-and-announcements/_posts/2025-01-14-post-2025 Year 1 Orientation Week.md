<p>Marking the start of their Rafflesian journey, our Year 1s, hailing from
121 different primary schools, participated in a fun-filled Orientation
Week programme from 2–7 January specially planned by their seniors from
the Leadership Boards. The week-long programme culminated in the Year 1
Orientation Concert, with each class presenting an original performance
based on the orientation theme,&nbsp;‘Different Stories, One Heartbeat’,
and the RGS Initiation Ceremony, where the Year 1s were presented to their
parents for the first time as full-fledged RGS students.</p>
