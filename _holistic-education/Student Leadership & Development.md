## Student Leadership & Development

#### CCA Leaders

Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) Chairpersons have a diverse range of responsibilities that vary from CCA to CCA, but all of them have two things in common – their burning passion for their CCA, and a deep sense of attachment to their seniors, juniors and batchmates. CCA Chairpersons are acknowledged school-wide as good role models, not just within their CCAs, but to their peers as well. CCA Chairpersons demonstrate their leadership in their expertise in the skills required for their CCAs, and in their constant drive to steer their CCA to greater heights.

#### House Executive Committee

The House Executive Committee is the youngest leadership board to be established. There are five Houses in RGS, and each is named after one of five consecutive RGS principals who had served the school. Chronologically, the Houses are Tarbet (Red), Buckle (Green), Richardson (Blue), Waddle (Yellow), and Hadley (Purple). Established by Miss Hadley during her term as principal from 1946 to 1950, the House System has always been an integral part of RGS, and a source of much pride. As a group, House leaders lead in organising and running House activities and Inter-House Games to encourage House spirit and nurture a sense of belonging in each student as they engage in healthy competition across Houses. They play a key role in integrating our Year 1s into the school culture and helping them develop a sense of pride in their House and in turn, the school.
