<p>On 17 October 2024, our SVIA team, Project Carb0n, organised a tree planting
session. This initiative aimed to raise awareness about the critical role
that trees play in reducing carbon emissions and enhancing biodiversity
within school environments.</p>
<p>Our enthusiastic Year 3 and Year 4 students actively participated in the
event, planting a total of 25 trees near the Butterfly Garden. These new
additions will help to enrich the landscape and foster a more vibrant ecosystem.
As part of a broader environmental plan, the Estate Department will plant
an additional 50 trees at a later date, helping to create a natural sound
barrier between Braddell Road and the Classroom Blocks.</p>
<p>Funds for the Trees for RGS project were raised through the sales of House
'Garden-inspired' merchandise, supporting our green initiatives.</p>
<p>This programme was held in support of the NParks OneMillionTrees movement,
a nationwide effort to plant a million trees across Singapore. Through
this collaborative effort, we aim to restore nature to our urban landscape
and build a City in Nature for future generations to enjoy. The OneMillionTrees
movement is a crucial part of the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which seeks
to transform our city into a greener, more sustainable environment.</p>
<p>Together, letâ€™s work towards a greener future!</p>
