<p>Meanwhile, CmPS Project Credence continued its efforts to support youths
aged 10 to 16 facing mental health challenges and low self-confidence.
The team hosted an interactive booth promoting food positivity, encouraging
youths to cultivate healthy eating habits. Through engaging games and activities,
participants gained valuable insights into nutrition and well-being in
a fun and interactive manner.</p>
<p>By integrating education with enjoyment, Project Credence continues to
make a positive impact on the community, striving to instil confidence
and self-assurance in the younger generation.</p>
<p>We are proud to see our students actively contributing to the community
and look forward to more such initiatives in the future!</p>
