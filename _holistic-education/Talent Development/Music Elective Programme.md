## Music Elective Programme

The Music Elective Programme (MEP) is offered by the Ministry of Education to enable musically inclined students the opportunity to deepen their knowledge in music and hone their abilities in listening, creating, performing and research. It aims to equip our young musicians with musical knowledge and a diverse range of skills, putting them in good stead to fulfil musical aspirations.

Beyond classroom learning, the enriching curriculum provides our students with opportunities for hands-on music-making, access to specialised facilities and learning opportunities with professionals in the creative industries. They will also enjoy opportunities to learn and collaborate with MEP students from other schools.
