## Vision Mission Values

At RGS, there are limitless possibilities on which each girl can build to realise her ambitions. Together with a strong record of achievements in both the academic and co-curricular domains, RGS girls are empowered to discover their own unique ways of making a difference in their communities, and in so doing, come to embody the school’s motto Filiae Melioris Aevi – Daughters of a Better Age.
