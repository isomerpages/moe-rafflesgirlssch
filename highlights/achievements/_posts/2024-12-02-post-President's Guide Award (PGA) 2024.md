<p>Three of our Year 4 students were proud recipients of the President's
Guide Award (PGA) 2024, a prestigious honour recognising their dedication
to the Guiding Movement and their commitment to upholding its values and
skills to the highest standards. Among only six Guides to receive this
award, they exemplify love for Guiding and an unwavering spirit of excellence.</p>

<p>The PGA, the highest accolade for a Guide, was presented by the President
of Singapore, making this achievement even more meaningful.</p>
<p>We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the teachers-in-charge for their
steadfast guidance and dedication. We are equally thankful to the parents
for their unwavering encouragement and support, which have been instrumental
in our students' success.</p>
<p>Congratulations to our awardees for this incredible achievement!</p>
