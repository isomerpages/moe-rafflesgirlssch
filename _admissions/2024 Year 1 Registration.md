## **RGS 2024 Year 1 Registration**

1. To all students posted to RGS Year 1 in 2024, congratulations and welcome! *(In RGS, we refer to Secondary 1 students as ‘Year 1s’ as they are in ‘Year 1’ of the 6-year Raffles Programme)*.

2. There will not be a need for you to report to RGS in person prior to 2 Jan 2024. Instead, you are **required to** **complete the Year 1 Registration online**.

3. Parents of all 2024 Year 1s are to submit contact details by completing this form at this link [https://go.gov.sg/rgs-2024y1-registration](https://go.gov.sg/rgs-2024y1-registration) as soon as they receive notification that their daughters have been posted to RGS on S1 Posting Results day.

4. Parents will then receive an SMS from RGS which will include a **unique login ID and password** to access the **RGS Year 1 Registration site** within 2 working days.

5. Parents and Year 1 students will access the Year 1 Registration site to:**

* find all the information needed to help students prepare for Year 1 in 2024.
* complete **compulsory administrative matters** that would need your attention and necessary action before the **deadline of 1700 hours on Saturday, 23 December 2023 (tentative)**.

* look up information on the purchase of books and uniforms. Sale of school books and uniforms will be available online and parents are encouraged to make online purchases, and arrange for home delivery or to collect their purchases at the respective stores. 

* The purchase of RGS School uniforms can be bought through the Bibi & Baba online store at this URL [https://www.schooluniforms.sg/raffles-girls-school](https://www.schooluniforms.sg/raffles-girls-school) or at Bibi & Baba shops. 

* Textbooks and stationery can be bought via the link [rgs.cascoedusupply.com.sg](https://cascoedusupply.com.sg/?schoolid=105).

* arrange school bus transport to RGS, if needed.

6. In RGS, all Year 1 students are required to use an **iPad** for learning. Specifications for the iPad are provided at the same site, along with information on how to purchase a new iPad if the Year 1 student does not have such a device or has one which does not meet the school’s specifications.

7. On the first day of school, i.e. Tuesday, 2 January 2024, Year 1 students are to report to RGS by 7.25am, in their RGS PE polo shirts, culottes and school shoes.
