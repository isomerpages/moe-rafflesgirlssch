## 22nd International Elementz Fair 2021

Five RGS Year 4 school-based research project teams took part in the 22nd International Elementz Fair, of which two were shortlisted for the final judging on 20 April 2021. Congratulations to the teams and teacher-mentors for their good work!

Through their research journey, the students learnt the value of group work, tenacity and a systematic approach to understand and solve a problem through their projects.

The annual International Elementz Fair, organised by Anderson Serangoon Junior College, provides a platform for local and overseas upper secondary and junior college students to showcase their scientific research, as well as prototypes, which can contribute to the betterment of society. The 22nd edition of the fair was held entirely online this year.
