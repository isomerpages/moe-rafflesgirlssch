<p>In support of MOE's efforts to promote student learning and appreciation
of Mother Tongue Languages and cultures, the RGS Languages Department organised
our very own Mother Tongue Fortnight for the whole of Term 1 Week 5 and
8.</p>

<p>This year’s theme “In Love with Languages” aims to foster in our students
a passion for cultural learning through a series of activities. These specially
curated activities provide authentic experiential opportunities for students
to use their Mother Tongue Languages, thereby deepening their sense of
belonging and rootedness to their culture.</p>
<p>Our Chinese students dazzled us with their musical prowess in the Voice
of RGS competition, while also delving into the art of Tea Appreciation
and Chinese calligraphy. Meanwhile, our Tamil students showcased their
creativity through Rangoli art and classical dance performances, alongside
participating in engaging workshops on poetry and e-book creation. Another
enthusiastic group - our Malay students - explored the traditional elegance
of the kebaya and dabbled in the world of Malay poetry, drama, and writing.</p>
<p>It was a fortnight filled with laughter, learning, and a deeper appreciation
for the rich tapestry of languages and cultures that make up our school
community.</p>
