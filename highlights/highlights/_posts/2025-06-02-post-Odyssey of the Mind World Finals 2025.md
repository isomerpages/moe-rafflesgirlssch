<p>Odyssey of the Mind (OM) is a programme where students embark on a six-month
journey to create a thrilling, high-energy performance based on a problem
set by the competition organisers at Odyssey HQ.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, our students—guided by their teacher-mentors—were
encouraged to explore new perspectives and push the limits of their creativity,
while still adhering to the rules and criteria for each problem.</p>
<p>In 2025, RGS sent three teams to represent Singapore at the OM World Finals,
held at Michigan State University in East Lansing, Michigan, USA.</p>
<p>Having been part of OM since 2023, <strong>Shan Haoyun</strong>, a Year
4 student, shares her reflection:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Paint stains on our hands, our culottes, even our faces. Walking across the galleria in full costume and getting so many weird looks from other students. Bursting into raucous laughter two minutes into every script read. When it comes to OM, that’s just the tip of the iceberg.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Our impossibly messy corner of the Makerspace holds infinite memories of all the blood, sweat, and tears my team has shed over the past six months. Hot glue gun burns, late-night Google Meets, hour-long crying sessions—we’ve been through it all. And we’ve finally made it through. Screaming the last few lines of our script together for the last time in an auditorium across the world made me realise just how worth it all of this has been.</em>
</p>
<p><em>This year marks the end of my three-year-long OM journey, and I will forever be grateful to OM for shaping me into who I am today. OM stretched me more than I ever thought possible, teaching me to face whatever comes my way, and helping me realise that the world is my stage. OM taught me to look where no one has looked before, and never to turn down any idea—after all, no idea is a bad one!</em>
</p>
<p><em>In OM, you find the core of creativity itself, and meet so many like-minded people who yearn to learn and try new things. It’s a programme that pushes you out of your comfort zone every single day, and constantly tests your patience and resolve. To my teammates and my coach, Ms Malyanah—thank you for believing in your team leader, and for allowing her to bring us to the world stage. OM will always have a special place in my heart, till the end of TIME!</em>
