<p>This inspiring event brought together passionate young changemakers, including
RGS students, to showcase their work and engage in meaningful discussions
on conservation and humanitarian efforts.</p>
<p>A key highlight of the summit was the presence of Dr Jane Goodall, who
visited as part of her tour of Singapore. Dr Goodall shared her profound
knowledge and unwavering passion for environmental conservation, providing
attendees with invaluable insights and inspiration. Her address motivated
students to take proactive roles in driving sustainable change.</p>
<p>The event was further graced by Minister for National Development and
Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration, Mr Desmond Lee, whose
participation underscored the importance of community-driven efforts in
fostering environmental stewardship and social cohesion.</p>
<p>In a special gesture, Dr Goodall generously donated eight trees to RGS,
which were planted on the school premises. During the tree planting ceremony,
Dr Goodall discovered a tiny frog. Demonstrating her deep care for all
living beings, she gently cusped the frog in her hands and paused the planting
to release it safely into the school pond before continuing. This heartwarming
moment perfectly captured her commitment to preserving life in all its
forms.</p>
<p>This initiative not only symbolises hope and sustainability but also enhances
biodiversity within the school environment.</p>
<p>RGS is honoured to support initiatives that empower youth to lead the
way in creating a better future for all.</p>
