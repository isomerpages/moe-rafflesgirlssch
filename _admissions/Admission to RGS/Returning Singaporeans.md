#### 3 \. Entrance Test into Year 3

Returning Singaporeans opting to sit for the RGS entrance tests and are shortlisted will have to take the English, Mathematics and Science papers. Shortlisted candidates will then be required to attend an interview. Admission to RGS will be based on the results of the entrance tests and the performance at the interview.  
  
Candidates who were successfully posted to a secondary school under the DSA-Sec Exercise are not allowed to transfer to another school as they are expected to honour their commitment to their posted school.
