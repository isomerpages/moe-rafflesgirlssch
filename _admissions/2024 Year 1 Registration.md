**4) Is there an orientation programme for Secondary 1s? If so, when will it be and what will happen then?**

There is an orientation programme for all Secondary 1 students. (In RGS, we refer to these students as ‘Year 1s’ as they are in ‘Year 1’ of the 6-year Raffles Programme). The 4-day Orientation Week in RGS begins on Tue 2 Jan 2024 and will end on Fri 5 Jan 2024. More details will be provided on the RGS Y1 Registration site.

**5) I cannot decide whether to take up a Third Language or an Elective Programme. Is it possible for me to register for a Third Language and also interview for an Elective Programme to keep my options open?**

It is strongly recommended that students consider their options carefully and adhere to the deadlines to submit their choices. In RGS, it is not possible to take both a Third Language and an Elective Programme as our timetable is planned in such a way that lessons for these programmes are scheduled on the same day; i.e. on Friday afternoons. Thus, your daughter cannot be in two programmes at the same time.

**6) What are the Elective Programmes offered in RGS and what are the pre-requisites for application?**

Information on these Elective Programmes can be found on our school’s website and more details are also shared on RGS Y1 Registration site. You are strongly encouraged to go through the detailed information on the website and not to miss the application deadlines.

**7) How many CCAs can a student take up?**

In RGS, all students take up **only one CCA**. This is to ensure that all students have a well-balanced RGS experience where they can also make time for other learning opportunities.

On average, every CCA has activities on at least two days of the week and the designated CCA days are Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Therefore, students are unable to take up more than one CCA as the CCAs occur at the same time.
