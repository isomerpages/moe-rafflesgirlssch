Our Mathematics curriculum is designed for our students to understand and apply mathematical concepts for effective problem solving. It is grounded in the view that the study of Mathematics is not just about rules and procedures, but also about seeking truth and beauty in patterns and logic, and solving problems which are modelled after real-life scenarios.
