Our Year 3 student leaders were invested into their new leadership roles at the annual Student Leaders’ Investiture. We were delighted to have Dr Seah Geok Bin (Class of 1982) to grace the event. Congratulations to all our newly-minted student leaders; and to all our outgoing student leaders, thank you for your dedication and service!
