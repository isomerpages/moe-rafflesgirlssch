<p>The Singapore Silent Heroes (SSH) Award Presentation is an annual ceremony
organised by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cas.sg/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Civilians Association (Singapore)</a>&nbsp;(CAS).
The award recognises ordinary, everyday Singaporeans and permanent residents
for their extraordinary humanity and compassion towards people, causes,
and missions.</p>
<p>In 2023, CAS introduced the SSH Student Award to acknowledge local students
from various schools for their acts of kindness.</p>
<p>We are proud to announce that the following students have received the
award for their outstanding contributions during their student-initiated
project:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Hasini Senthilnathan, S404 - Project Enjo</p>
<p>Hasini was a leading member of Project Enjo, a completely student-initiated
project that began in early 2023. The team, comprising 7 students,&nbsp;has
steadfastly supported children under Brighton Connection’s care during
the school holidays. Their focus on developing character, values, and academic
support through engaging activities has made a positive impact on the lives
of these children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Janhvi, S406 - Project STEMulate</p>
<p>Janhvi is one of the leading members of Project STEMulate, another student-initiated
project that started in early 2023. This team, comprising 7 students, meaningfully
engages&nbsp;children in STEM-related activities during school holidays,
offering&nbsp;opportunities to explore, create, and innovate. Janhvi served
as the main liaison with the Beyond Social Services staff, taking time
to build a relationship with them and understand their needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bhattacharyya Atreyi, S406 - Project STEMulate</p>
<p>Atreyi is a leading member of Project STEMulate which comprises 7 students.
She was instrumental in spearheading and steering this completely student-initiated
project which started in early 2023. This initiative provides educationally
disadvantaged children with opportunities to explore, create, and innovate
on&nbsp;STEM-related activities during their school holidays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflecting on her project, Janhvi shared:&nbsp; “The greatest joy in serving
the community comes from the profound impact we make and the friendships
we form with the young people we help. Each child I have met has taught
me invaluable lessons and shown me their unique strengths, enriching my
life in countless ways. My deepest hope is to inspire fellow students to
take that first step, to actively engage, and to build meaningful connections
with the communities they aspire to uplift. I believe that no one is ever
too young to make a difference in someone else’s world.”</p>
<p>We hope these girls will continue to positively impact their community
and inspire their peers to do the same.</p>
