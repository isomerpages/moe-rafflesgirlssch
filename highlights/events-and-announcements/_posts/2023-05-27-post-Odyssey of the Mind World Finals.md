Odyssey of the Mind is a programme where students embark on a 6-month journey to create a thrilling, high-energy performance based around a problem set by the competition organisers, Odyssey HQ. Throughout the process our students, guided by their teacher-mentors, were encouraged to find new perspectives to push the limits of their creativity, while adhering to the rules and criteria for each problem.

Our teams demonstrated exceptional performance, securing remarkable results in their respective divisions.
