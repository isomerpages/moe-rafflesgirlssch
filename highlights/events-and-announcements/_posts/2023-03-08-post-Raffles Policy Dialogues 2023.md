We were delighted to host the Raffles Policy Dialogue (RPD) on 8 March 2023. Led by the student organising team, the RPD is a dialogue session that addresses deep-lying societal issues in Singapore. Its aim is to promote youth awareness and encourage discussion on these issues at a policy level.  
  
This year's dialogue, titled 'Hustling Sustainably in a Future Workplace,' featured an exciting panel of speakers, including our alumnae, Ms Rachel Eng and Dr Jade Kua.  
  
2023’s RPD also marks the first time a face-to-face session was held since Covid-19 and we’re proud to host students from Beatty Secondary School, Deyi Secondary School, Guangyang Secondary School, Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School as well as Raffles Institution, over at our Braddell Campus.  
  
We would like to thank the speakers for their insightful sharing and to the participating schools for supporting our programme.
