<p>SYPT&nbsp;seeks to bring students through a process of what physicists
do, from research to modelling, experimentation and finally to an oral
presentation before peers and experts. It provides authentic learning experiences
in the learning of physics.&nbsp;</p>

<div class="isomer-card-description">My SYPT journey was exciting and fulfilling. Investigating real-world
phenomena deepened my physics knowledge and research skills. I especially
enjoyed the Physics Fights, where I defended my project and challenged
others. Overall, it was an enriching experience shared with my teammates.</div>

<div class="isomer-card-description">SYPT was a highlight of my RGS journey, a decision I’ll never regret.
It exposed me to advanced physics and pushed me beyond my limits. I grew
more self-directed and resilient while forming close bonds with my teammates.
I'm deeply grateful to the Teachers-in-Charge for their unwavering support.</div>
