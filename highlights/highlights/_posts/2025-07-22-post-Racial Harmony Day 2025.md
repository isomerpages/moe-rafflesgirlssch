<p><em>Our People, Our Tapestry</em>
</p>
<p>This year’s Racial Harmony Day celebrations reminded us that Singapore’s
multicultural identity is not just something we inherit but something we
continuously shape together.</p>
<p>Through vibrant performances, meaningful conversations, and shared experiences
across food, games, and crafts, we celebrated the beauty of cultural exchange
and reflected on how each thread in our national tapestry contributes to
its strength and vibrancy.</p>
<p>A heartfelt thank you to the Parents for RGS Association (PRGS) for their
enthusiastic support, and to the RHD 2025 Organising Committee for curating
an experience that inspired deeper understanding and unity.</p>
<p>Let us continue to honour our shared heritage with respect, openness,
and care.</p>
