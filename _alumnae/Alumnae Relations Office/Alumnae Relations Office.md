## Alumnae Relations Office

#### Message from RGS Alumnae Relations Office

RGSâ€™ enduring legacy is its sisterhood, nurtured through collective learning experiences and friendships. The RGS Alumnae Office seeks to maintain these relationships and links through regular updates on school events and by offering platforms for alumnae interactions. Through these connections, we enable our alumnae to give back to their alma mater so that this rich legacy of sisterhood endures.

Our Mission and Goals are as follows:

**Mission:**

To connect the alumnae with their alma mater through mutually beneficial interactions

**Goals**  

*   Create platforms for alumnae to give back to the organisation; eg, Career talks; Gifting &nbsp;
*   Facilitate alumnae networking and connections; eg School Reunions
*   Facilitate alumnae connections with current students; eg, Mentoring
*   Showcase alumnae stories

You may consider membership in the&nbsp;[RGS Alumnae](http://rgsalumnae.com/), a registered society that seeks to connect members through diverse projects and gatherings.
