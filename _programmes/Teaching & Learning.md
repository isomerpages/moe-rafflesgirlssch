## Teaching & Learning

The Raffles classroom fosters a passion for lifelong learning through the following approaches:

*   Authentic: Draws on real-world knowledge of local and global contexts
*   Learner-centred: Encourages active participation, exploration, discovery and collaboration among learners
*   Process-focused: Emphasises ways of thinking and the development of disciplinary skills in the various fields
*   Integrative: Builds on the inter-connectedness of ideas across disciplines

Hence, teaching and learning here is always Learner-Centred, Teacher-Facilitated with continuous feedback and support. Students are prepared for life-long learning, discovering their interests and strengths and pursuing what they are passionate about as they journey through the Raffles Programme in RGS.
