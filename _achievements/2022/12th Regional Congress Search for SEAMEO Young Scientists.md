## 12th Regional Congress Search for SEAMEO Young Scientists

Three RGS Year 4 students took part in the 12th Regional Congress Search for SEAMEO Young Scientists (SSYS) and were awarded the Outstanding Award for Online Oral Presentation (Science Category). The team was the only award-winning team out of the two teams representing Singapore!
