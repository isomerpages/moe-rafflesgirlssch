<h2>The House System in RGS</h2>

</div>
<p>There are five Houses in RGS, and each is named after one of five consecutive
RGS principals who had served the school. Chronologically, the Houses are
Tarbet (Red), Buckle (Green), Richardson (Blue), Waddle (Yellow), and Hadley
(Purple). Established by Miss Hadley during her term as principal from
1946 to 1950, the House System has always been an integral part of RGS,
and a source of much pride.</p>
<h3>House Spirit</h3>

<p>As a group, House leaders lead in organising and running House activities
and Inter-House Games to encourage House spirit and nurture a sense of
belonging in each student as they engage in healthy competition across
Houses. They play a key role in integrating our Year 1s into the school
culture and helping them develop a sense of pride in their House and in
turn, the school.</p>

<h3>The 5 Houses</h3>

</div>
<p>Each Rafflesian, as well as staff member, is allocated to one of the 5
houses, each with their own unique mascots; the bull, elf, genie, duck
and monkey respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2011, Houses designed their own House Crests, which are proudly worn
by House members, and can be seen on the house T-shirts until today.</p>

<p>All Y1 Rafflesians also participate in a series of House Practices, where
they strengthen bonds with their fellow House members through the various
activities and also learning their House cheers. House Practices are integral
to the RGS culture, instilling a sense of House pride in each new House
member.</p>
<p>Today, the House spirit continues to grow stronger, contributing to the
blossoming of the school spirit.</p>
