Introduced in 2016, the SJBO is organised by The Singapore Institute of Biology in collaboration with Science Centre Singapore, and supported by the Ministry of Education. 

This competition provides a platform for upper secondary students to challenge themselves further in the area of biology with emphasis on critical thinking skills. 

The top seven performing schools in the theory round were shortlisted for the practical round that was conducted at the Singapore Zoo on 16 August 2023. Amidst stiff competition from the other schools, RGS is proud to share that the following girls emerged as Champions!
