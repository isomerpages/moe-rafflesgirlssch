<p>On 13 April 2024, we presented the Raffles Scholarship to 133 student
recipients from over 73 primary schools across Singapore.</p>
<p>The ceremony was attended by Raffles Institution's principal, Mr. Aaron
Loh, and RGS principal, Mrs. Ong Hong Peng, along with key personnel from
both schools.</p>
<p>We also welcomed principals, vice-principals, and teachers from the recipients'
primary schools, highlighting the strong community support for these young
scholars.</p>
<p>We hope these scholarships inspire the recipients to seek opportunities
for growth and to strive towards becoming their best selves.</p>
