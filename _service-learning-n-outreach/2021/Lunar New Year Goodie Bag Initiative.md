## Lunar New Year Goodie Bag Initiative

In collaboration with Xin Yuan Community Care Centre, the RGS Languages Department spearheaded a school-wide Lunar New Year Goodie Bag Initiative. Students and staff, working within their classes and departments respectively, purchased essential items and festive goodies, designed festive greeting cards, and packed them into goodie bags for 75 low-income families around the Braddell-Toa Payoh community in hopes of spreading some joy to the families this festive period.  
  
A big thanks to our DSA-Community Youth Leadership students who provided the extra support by helping to ensure that the goodie bags are in order, and to some of our teachers and staff who offered to ferry the goodie bags over to the centre.
