<h2><strong>Appeal for School Transfer After Secondary One Posting</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Application Period and Eligibility</strong>
</p>
<p>Application for Appeal to Transfer to RGS after Secondary One Posting
2024 is meant for Primary 6 students who sat for the PSLE in 2024.</p>
<p>Students who have been posted to a school via DSA-Sec Exercise are <strong>NOT</strong> allowed
to participate in this Appeal Exercise as they are expected to honour their
commitment to the posted DSA school for the duration of the programme that
they were admitted into.</p>
<p>Please note that each year, only a small number of students, if any, will
be admitted through this appeal exercise as RGS is not at liberty to create
additional spaces in the school.</p>
<p>Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.</p>
<p>Admissions through the Appeal Exercise will be based on objective and
transparent measures of academic merit, i.e. PSLE performance before they
can be considered. Students must meet the RGS cut-off point for the same
year before they can be considered for the transfer.</p>
<p>Students who wish to gain admission to RGS on the basis of other talents
and achievements would have had the option of participating in the Direct
Schools Admissions (DSA) Exercise, which were conducted and concluded in
September.</p>
<p>Successful applicants will be notified via phone call or email. Hence,
applicants must be reachable by phone at the local number(s) provided on
the application.</p>
<p>The application will be deemed incomplete and will not be considered if
applicant cannot be contacted or are unable to produce the original documents
for verification purposes upon request.</p>
<p>To apply, please click <a href="https://form.gov.sg/65659a0017464c0011a41c13" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> to complete
the online application. <strong>Application opens from 9am on 18 December 2024 to 9am, 23 December 2024.</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Secondary One Registration Day</strong>
</p>
<p>Pending the outcome of appeal, all applicants are required to complete
the S1 Registration of the secondary school that they are posted to by
the Ministry of Education. RGS will assist with the transfer process if
the applicant is eventually successful in her application for transfer.</p>
<h2><strong>Frequently Asked Questions</strong></h2>
<p><strong>1)What is the school’s entry scores (cut-off point or COP)?</strong>
</p>
<p>The school’s entry scores (COP) given as total Achievement Levels (AL)
will only be made known by MOE after the results of the PSLE posting every
year. We have yet to receive information from MOE on the COP for our 2025
Year 1 students. (RGS’s PSLE COP for 2023’s P6 cohort was AL 6.)</p>
<p><strong>2) I am posted to a school through the DSA exercise (including NUS High School, School of Science and Technology, School of the Arts and Singapore Sports School). I want to transfer to RGS now. How can I do so?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students who have already gained admission into a secondary school via
DSA or AEIS are NOT allowed to participate in the S1 Posting Exercise and
Post-PSLE Supplementary Exercise (Appeal for transfer). Students who have
been posted to a school via DSA must remain committed to that choice of
secondary school as a condition when you accepted the Confirmed Offer from
that secondary school.</p>
<p><strong>3) In the event that I am not successful in being posted to RGS, how can I appeal?</strong>
</p>
<p>The appeal process starts on the day the PSLE posting results are released.
Registration for appeal has to be done through e-application via the RGS
Admission site. Please click <a href="https://www.rgs.edu.sg/admissions/Admission-to-RGS/appeal/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">here</a> for
details. <strong>Application will open from 9am, Wednesday 18 Dec 2024 to 9am, Friday 23 Dec 2024.</strong>
</p>
<p>This appeal process is not applicable to students who have already gained
admission to a secondary school via DSA or AEIS.</p>
<p><strong>4) What is the criteria for admission through Post-PSLE Supplementary Intake, i.e. Appeal?</strong>
</p>
<p>Admissions through the Post-PSLE Supplementary Intake Exercise (appeal
to transfer to RGS) will be based on academic merit, i.e. PSLE performance,
and objective measures.</p>
<p>Students who wish to gain admission to RGS on the basis of other talents
and achievements would have had the option of participating in the Direct
Schools Admissions (DSA) Exercise, which was completed in September 2024.</p>
<p><strong>5) What are my chances when I appeal?</strong>
</p>
<p>We are unable to advise you on this as your appeal is dependent on the
total number of ‘appeal’ applications and the number of vacancies available
for the year.</p>
<p><strong>6) What was the total enrolment for Year 1 (Secondary 1) last year?</strong>
</p>
<p>The total Year 1 enrolment for 2024 at RGS was around 400 students.</p>
<p><strong>7) How many applications of appeal were received last year?</strong>
</p>
<p>The number of applications and number of vacancies available at the appeal
stage vary from year to year.</p>
<p><strong>8) Do I have to report to the secondary school that I was posted to while waiting for the result of my appeal, and when will the results be announced?</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are to complete their Secondary 1 registration with the secondary
school that they have been posted to as per MOE’s instructions. Students
need not buy uniforms and books as yet because they have appealed to be
considered for admission to other schools. If students are successful in
their appeals to RGS, they will be contacted via phone or email by Monday
30 December 2024 (tentative). All appeal applicants will receive an email
informing them about the results of their applications by <strong>Tuesday 31 December 2024.</strong>
