Organised by the Institute of Physics, Singapore (IPS) with support from the Ministry of Education (MOE), SJPO is a competition for secondary school students, aimed at encouraging the study and appreciation of physics beyond the school curriculum. This annual competition provides opportunities for students to solve novel physics problems that require critical and inventive thinking.
