<h2><strong>Events</strong></h2>
<p>The Parents for RGS Association (PRGS) was established in 2003. We work
closely with the school to provide a support network for parents/guardians
of RGS students, and organise activities to allow our members to develop
and maintain links with the school. We also collaborate with the school
in running programmes to facilitate our members’ and their daughters’/wards’
journeys through RGS.</p>

<h4>Parent &amp; Child Bonding Events</h4>

</div>
<p>Kickstarting the year was a special talk by best-selling author and international
speaker, Andrew Matthews. This was followed by many more parent-and-child
bonding workshops held throughout the year to engage parents and their
daughters: the Prata Journey, a prata-flipping workshop, the K-Pop Dance
Date with your daughter, the Mother’s Day workshop where mothers and daughters
crafted their own floral arrangements and painted their own Janice Wong’s
Pure Imagination chocolate squares as gifts for Mum, and a Crochet Date
with your Daughter workshop. We received an overwhelming response and thank
parents for taking time out of their busy schedules to bond with their
daughters over these fun activities.</p>
<h4>Parenting Talks</h4>
<p>PRGS organises numerous talks for parents to equip them with the necessary
information as they journey with their daughters over the 4 years at RGS.
&nbsp;One of the highly anticipated events is the annual Breakfast Dialogues
with the Principals series, offering tailored sessions for Year 2, Year
3 and Year 4 parents. These small-group gatherings provided an intimate
setting for parents to engage in meaningful discussions on topics relevant
to their child’s year, which they found immensely valuable and insightful.</p>

<p>A new and special series of university admissions talks was launched in
2024 to help parents and their daughters to plan and prepare for university.
The first session on US universities (which was also open to the whole
Raffles family, including Year 5-6 students and RGS alumnae) received tremendous
interest and positive feedback. The subsequent session on Singapore Management
University, which included a campus tour, was similarly successful. Parents
certainly appreciated the university talks, and PRGS will strive to organise
more in future. The talks follow in the tradition of the annual transition
talk (from RGS to Raffles Institution), as activities aimed at equipping
parents and our girls with ample knowledge for their educational journey
toward excellence.</p>

<p>Making a comeback for the second year was a talk on AI, this time focused
on generative AI technologies. Many parents attended, wanting to know more
to help their daughters leverage technology to aid their schoolwork.</p>
<h4>Partnering RGS to Create Holistic Fun for Our Girls</h4>
<p>PRGS has always focused on the well-being of both parents and our daughters.
While numerous events were held to engage parents, PRGS continued to support
RGS in organising fun activities for our girls. 2024 saw SportsFest return
to an external venue after several years due to the COVID pandemic. Held
at Serangoon Stadium, PRGS produced our very own sports towel for the girls
and got the Milo van down! It was certainly a delicious treat for both
the girls and RGS staff. We also sponsored Magnolia ice cream, Oreo cookies,
gummy bears, healthy cookies, and even procured sponsorship for Jia Jia
Herbal drinks to cool everyone down at the end of the event. The excitement
and cheers ended Term 2 on a high note!</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>School reopened in Term 3 after the June break with yet another whole-school
event: the annual Racial Harmony Day which PRGS proudly organised with
the school to showcase the different cultures in Singapore. Our very own
kacang puteh man and women dressed up to serve a tasty traditional mix
of nuts and crackers to the girls. Various traditional games like five
stones, pick-up sticks, capteh, and gasing (spinning top) gave the girls
the chance to enjoy “old school” activities. Enthusiastic parent volunteers
also facilitated hands-on experiences such as Chinese lucky knot-tying
and interactive appreciation of the aromatics used in bunga rampai. The
highlight of the event was definitely the potong ice cream, which the girls
relished during the warm afternoon of fun!</p>

</div>
<p>As the year came to an end, PRGS continued to deepen its support for the
girls. For the first time, a special care pack containing a mini crochet
toy with notes of encouragement was lovingly prepared for every girl to
comfort and cheer them on as they prepare for the End-of-Year examinations.
Both girls and parents were extremely delighted to receive them, and many
came forward to express their gratitude.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;The GLOW personal grooming workshop continued to be a staple in
the after-exams series of activities. Mothers volunteered to teach a two-hour
workshop, which was an especially meaningful woman-to-woman sharing session,
facilitating personal grooming advice to the girls.</p>
<h4>Tribute to RGS</h4>
<p>The school has been an excellent pillar of support in nurturing our girls
to be Daughters of a Better Age. As RGS commemorated its 145th anniversary
in 2024, PRGS continued to support the school with its annual PRGS award
to two deserving girls annually who demonstrated good character and values
– Feng Chenyu (S301) and Aurelie Tan (S411). PRGS also supported the school’s
Founder’s Day celebration with a dessert table featuring a grand croquembouche
tower cake. This delectable and intricately built assemblage received nothing
short of rave reviews!</p>

<p>It takes a village to raise a child, they say, and certainly, we can be
so proud of how eagerly and selflessly a group of devoted educators and
staff rallied around our daughters, working to maximise each girl’s potential.
PRGS is especially proud and happy to acknowledge the RGS team for their
dedication with the tradition of the Staff Appreciation Lunch Extravaganza.
The 22nd PRG Exco wishes to thank PRGS members who made the celebrations
possible through their generous contributions of funds. The theme for this
year’s celebration was “Around the World”, where RGS staff were treated
with the highest level of service from the PRGS Exco (who dressed up as
cabin crew). The menu featured an array of main dishes and street food
from around the world including Mexican churros and nachos, Middle Eastern
kebabs, Indian pani puri, along with a lavish Indian, Peranakan and Western
buffet spread. The day’s entertainment opened with parents performing a
fast K-Pop dance, followed by the MEP girls who provided more “in-flight”
entertainment. Every staff member went home with a prize and a PRGS travel
bag, in keeping with the Around-the-world theme.</p>

<p>Ending the year was the annual Farewell Alma Mater (FAM) ceremony, and
PRGS gifted each Year 4 student a personalised thermos, along with a generous
contribution to the school fund for organising the graduation event. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Sports Fest</strong></h3>
<p>2023 Sports Fest was held at the end of term 2. PRGS provided snacks and
refreshments to sustain the girls through the day’s activities, helped
man some of the games stations, and also participated in the Staff Race,
where we successfully defended our title for the 5th consecutive year!</p>

<h3><strong>Racial Harmony Day</strong></h3>
<p>Racial Harmony Day on 18 July brought lots of fun not just to the students,
but for the 54 parent volunteers who helped pack 1,700 individual traditional
snacks for the girls. It was an immersive experience where the girls had
the chance to learn about traditional games and win $100 worth of prizes
sponsored by PRGS, taste popular hawker fare, and try their hand at cooking
traditional food items at the huat kueh, burfi and ondeh-ondeh workshops.
The girls also enjoyed learning about Peranakan culture and ended their
day with delicious potong ice-creams!</p>

<h3><strong>Founder's Day</strong></h3>
<p>This year’s Founder’s Day saw PRGS presenting the PRGS Award to two deserving
girls who demonstrated good character and values – Megan Koh (412) and
Rachael Yeo (408). PRGS was delighted to recognise these outstanding students
who have demonstrated good character and values. In addition, PRGS also
gifted RGS with a pair of balloon sculptures showcasing two students presenting
flowers to the school. The balloons were a hit with everyone!</p>

<h3><strong>Staff Appreciation Day</strong></h3>
<p>PRGS organised a Staff Appreciation Day lunch for all RGS members of staff
on 30 Aug 2023. With a theme of “When TV Comes Alive”, the school’s Multi-Purpose
Hall was transformed with beautiful décor comprising handmade TV boxes,
balloons and other decorative items to thank both the academic and non-academic
staff of RGS for their hard work in the school community. The RGS staff
certainly rose to the occasion with many decked in outfits from the Hospital
Playlist, Despicable Me, Powerpuff Girls, Super Mario Bros, Spiderman,
MasterChef and other TV shows. The PRGS Exco made a grand entrance dressed
up in Squid Game outfits and showcased an opening performance to the delight
of everyone. Every staff member was also gifted a personalised cushion
to signify the unwavering support of “parents having their back”.&nbsp;
Whether the staff are on the office chair in school or watching TV at home
on a couch, just as the cushion cradles their back, it embodies parents’
pledge to standby them, complementing their relentless efforts in nurturing
our daughters. The staff were also treated to a wide variety of Thai, Italian,
Chinese, and Indian cuisine, topped with a scrumptious chocolate and fruits
fondue<s> </s>!</p>

<h3><strong>Social Walk to Passion Wave &amp; Marina Bay</strong></h3>
<p>Recognising quality time as one of the five love languages, PRGS organised
our first Family Walk to Passion Wave @ Marina Bay for families to get
together for half a day of fun and bonding. The event not only bonded families
but also forged new friendships between PRGS members.</p>

<h3><strong>Dance Date with your Daughter</strong></h3>
<p>As a post-exam activity, PRGS organised a "Dance Date with your Daughter"
session on 14 October 2023 at the school's Black Box. Mothers, Fathers
and their daughters, were led by dance instructors from Happi Dance in
an hour of joyful dancing and bonding!</p>

<h3><strong>GLOW Programme</strong></h3>
<p>In partnership with PRGS, the school conducted the inaugural Y1 Glow Programme
which aims to guide students to be more self-aware as they build their
self-confidence in teen hood. &nbsp;&nbsp;The content of the programme
was curated by RGS teachers and a two-hour session was facilitated by PRGS
mothers for twelve Y1 classes.&nbsp; The students were taught the concept
of positive body image and the importance of personal grooming with practical
tips to present themselves with confidence.</p>

<h3><strong>Farewell Alma Mater</strong></h3>
<p>PRGS was also very happy to be able to participate in the send-off for
our Year 4 girls at the Farewell Alma Mater event on 27 October 2023, where
we gave each girl an RGS hot tumbler personalised with their names and
year of graduation.&nbsp; A practical and meaningful gift to commemorate
the girls’ formative years at RGS!</p>

<h3><strong>Breakfast Dialogues and Parenting Talks</strong></h3>
<p>Apart from these one-off events, PRGS also organised a series of parenting
talks throughout 2023, as well as “Breakfast Dialogue with Principals”
sessions for each of the year groups. The parenting talks were chosen to
address relevant issues, including “Stepping into the era of VR/AR and
AI” and, for our Year 4 parents, transitioning to Year 5 in Raffles Institution.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Breakfast Dialogues with Principals were held across the year, with
parents from each year group being able to direct any concerns they had
in a small-group setting to Principal Ms Haslinda, the Deputy Principals,
and other school leaders. This has traditionally been a very valuable source
of feedback both for the school and for parents, and this year’s sessions
proved to be no different, with it being very clear from these</p>

<h3><strong>Farewell to Principal, Ms Haslinda</strong></h3>
<p>As announced by MOE, Ms Haslinda will be stepping down as Principal of
RGS on 15 Dec 2023. At the annual PRGS Exco Social Gathering, we bade Ms
Haslinda farewell with a specially curated photo collage as a token of
appreciation. PRGS Exco also initiated an e-<s> &nbsp;</s>scrapbook for
parents to express their well wishes to Ms Haslinda.</p>
