## HUSH-STEM Week 2021

As part of HUSH-STEM Week 2021, the Indoor Farm Learning Journey was held in RGS' very own Food Lab! Conducted by Mr Darren Ho, a modern-day agriculturalist from his own company, Petalicious Farm, our students were excited to learn more of how Singapore aspires to achieve her own food sustainability in the future. In fact, our students all had the chance to be farmers as they got to take home a personal micro green growing kit.
