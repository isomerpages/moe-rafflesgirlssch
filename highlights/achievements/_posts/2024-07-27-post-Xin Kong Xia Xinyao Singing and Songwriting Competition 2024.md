Language Learning, TCR Music Station, Lianhe Zaobao, and Jurong Pioneer
Junior College. The Grand Finals took place on 27 July 2024 at Our Tampines

<p>This competition aims to preserve Chinese cultural heritage, spark interest
in Xinyao and Chinese language learning among Singapore’s youth, and offer
a platform for students to appreciate and express Chinese culture creatively.
It features participants from various primary and secondary schools, as
well as tertiary institutions.</p>
