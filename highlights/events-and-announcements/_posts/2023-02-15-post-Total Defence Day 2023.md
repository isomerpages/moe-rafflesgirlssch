The theme for Total Defence Day 2023 - “Together We Keep Singapore Strong” – focuses on the many ways we can put Total Defence into action in our everyday lives. 

Total Defence remains relevant to deal with the ever-evolving threats and challenges to Singapore. These include misinformation, supply chain disruptions, and food security, which affect communities and Singapore’s way of life. Every Singaporean has a part to play in our daily lives to ensure that Singapore is prepared for crises and disruptions and that we remain resilient and united as one people.
