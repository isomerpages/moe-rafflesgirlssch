<p>Our girls participated in the 10th Annual International Mathematical Modelling
Challenge (IM<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>C), a competition designed to
promote the teaching and application of mathematical modelling on the international
stage. The IM<strong><sup>2</sup></strong>C demonstrates how mathematics
can be used to understand, analyse, and solve real-world problems, highlighting
its significance in both educational and practical contexts.</p>

<p>RGS was honoured to be one of two teams selected to represent Singapore
in 2024, a remarkable achievement as past participants were typically chosen
from the JC or Year 5-6 level. The competition required the use of various
mathematical techniques and emphasised the importance of teamwork and time
management. Over five consecutive days, our students worked intensively
on a real-world problem, gaining valuable insights into how mathematics
can explain and impact the world around us.</p>

<p>We are proud to announce that our team received an Honourable Mention
for the solution they presented. Congratulations to our outstanding team
members:</p>
