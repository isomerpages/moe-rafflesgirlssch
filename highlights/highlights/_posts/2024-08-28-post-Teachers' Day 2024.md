<p>"Sunny day, sweepin’ the clouds away…"</p>
<p>This Teachers’ Day, we transformed RGS into our very own Sesame Street!
Just like the characters who make learning fun, our House Exco members
led a joyful celebration dedicated to our amazing teachers and non-teaching
staff who make every day at RGS extraordinary!</p>
<p>They were treated to delightful performances from our talented students
and some of our very own teachers, who showcased their incredible skills
on stage! Special awards were presented to our teachers, reminding us all
of the countless ways they help our students grow smarter, stronger, and
kinder—just like the lessons learned on Sesame Street.</p>
<p>As we celebrate Teachers’ Day, let’s give a big Sesame Street cheer for
our incredible teachers. Your commitment to shaping the next generation
of Daughters of a Better Age is truly commendable! Happy Teachers’ Day—you’re
the stars of our show!</p>
