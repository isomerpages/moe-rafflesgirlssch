Gifted Education Branch (GEB) of the Ministry of Education (MOE) for students
involved in scientific research through the Science Mentorship Programme
(SMP) or the School-Based Science Mentorship Programme (SB-SMP).</p>

<div class="isomer-card-description">Our SMP journey, from refining coding skills to switching projects, has
been fulfilling and something we're proud of. We worked hard as a team
and as best friends. Deep thanks to RGS and Ms Cheong for her unwavering
support and feedback—we couldn’t have achieved this without her.</div>

<p>Participants had the opportunity to accompany their posters with oral
presentations, allowing them to present their research findings and receive
valuable feedback from professional scientists.</p>
<p>We extend our appreciation to the teacher mentors who guided students
throughout their research journey. The following teachers were duly recognised
by GEB at the conference for their contributions:</p>
