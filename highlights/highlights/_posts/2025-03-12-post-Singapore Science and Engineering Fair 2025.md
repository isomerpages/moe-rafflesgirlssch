<p>We also extend our heartiest congratulations to RGS alumnae Felicia Tan
Ee Shan and Low Li Ying Amy (Class of 2023), who were awarded the Gold
Award. They will go on to represent Singapore at the Regeneron International
Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF) 2025, which will be held from 10 to
16 May in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<h4>STEM for Good! Contest</h4>
<p>As part of SSEF’s Silver Jubilee (25 years) and SG60 twin commemoration,
a new STEM for Good! contest was launched for MOE primary and secondary
schools. The competition challenged students to:</p>
<p>Identify a future problem or challenge that could arise in 10–20 years’
time in Singapore and explain how STEM can be applied to solve the problem,
along with how the proposed solution can benefit Singapore and/or humanity.</p>
<p>Our Team submitted a compelling project titled “Care in Crises: Addressing
Singapore’s Healthcare Crisis in 2040.” Their project was recognised as
one of the Top 3 entries in the Lower Secondary Category, a testament to
their foresight and innovative spirit:</p>
