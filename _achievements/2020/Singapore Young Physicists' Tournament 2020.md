## Singapore Young Physicists' Tournament 2020

Three RGS Year 4 students Wang Yifei, Sun Xiaoqing and Tham Yun Xin represented the school in Category B of the Singapore Young Physicists' Tournament (SYPT) 2020, and after many months of preparation, the team emerged as the Gold Award winners and champion team, a historical win as they are the first all-girls team to have won the accolade!  
  
In Category A of the tournament, RGS alumnae Yang Liu, Tan Wei Tian Mireille and Selina Peh Yuet Ning received the Bronze Award. They had taken part in the revised format of the finals due to the COVID-19 situation, where they had to present their reports and posters via a video conference with the jurors.  
  
Congratulations to the teams and also to our teachers from the RGS Science department Ms Angel Lim, Mr Tan Hup Yew, Mr Yang Kian Hong and Ms Cheong Szu Chuang who mentored the girls.

SYPT seeks to bring students through a process of what physicists do, from research to modelling, experimentation and finally to an oral defence before peers and experts. It provides authentic learning experiences in the learning of physics. Participants of the SYPT stand to represent Singapore in the International Young Physicists' Tournament.
