## The 7th ASEAN Student Science Project Competition (ASPC)

The 7th ASEAN Student Science Project Competition (ASPC), jointly organised by the National Science Museum Thailand and the Science Society of Thailand, was held from 7 - 8 September 2021. The yearly competition aims to promote science awareness through science project activities and creating a network of students and teachers among the ASEAN community.

In this year's edition of the competition, two out of eight projects from RGS were selected during the Singapore Science and Engineering Fair by MOE to represent Singapore. The two RGS projects performed extremely well in their respective categories.
