#### Celebrating 144 years of Nurturing Daughters of a Better Age!

Joy filled the air as we celebrated our 144th Founder’s Day! The celebration was made even more memorable with the launch of our very own Edible Garden, sponsored by Tanoto Foundation who had also contributed generously to the construction of our Evelyn Norris Auditorium, and the 10th Anniversary of the RGS Consuming Passion - Memories from the Rafflesian Table cookbook, a fund-raising project initiated by former principal Mrs Carmee Lim and her RGS friends.

We were honoured to have lawyer, poet and playwright Ms Amanda Chong (Class of 2005) as our guest of honour.

What’s a birthday without a cake? We would like to thank Raffles Girls' School Alumnae (RGSA) for the beautiful birthday cake and specially designed cupcakes!

Our thanks also go to the Parents for RGS Association (PRGS) for the delightful balloon sculpture, and our educational partners for your gift of flowers and well-wishes.

For bringing the entire community together, celebrating how the school has grown, and rekindling cherished traditions, we owe a heartfelt gratitude to our Board of Governors, Parents for RGS (PRGS), RGS Alumnae (RGSA), Programme Partners, alumnae, parents, staff and students.

Filiae Melioris Aevi!
