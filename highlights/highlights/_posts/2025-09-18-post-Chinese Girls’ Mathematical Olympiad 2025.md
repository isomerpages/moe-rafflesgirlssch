<p>Over the years, the Chinese Girls’ Mathematical Olympiad (CGMO) has grown
from a national event in China to an international competition, with teams
from various countries, including Singapore, invited to participate. To
qualify, the top-performing girls from Singapore schools undergo a rigorous
selection process.</p>
<p>This year, six students from Singapore, including one from RGS, were selected
to represent the nation. Our very own Luo Xinya (S109) achieved a Silver
Award at CGMO 2025.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her experience, Xinya shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“CGMO 2025 was truly an enriching experience. From forging friendships with like-minded peers to building resilience through the challenges I faced, this journey was both challenging and rewarding. I am extremely grateful for this opportunity and look forward to embarking on similar trips in the future.”</em>
