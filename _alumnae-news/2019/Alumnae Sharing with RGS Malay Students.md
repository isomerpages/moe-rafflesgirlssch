RGS has long been lauded for having strong bonds with our alumnae. Many of our alumnae have reached out to the school to give back in their own unique ways.

Recently, a few of our RGS alumnae who were from the RGS Malay Society reached out to the school to explore options on how they can add value and help the current RGS Malay students navigate through the various experiences and thought processes of a maturing young lady while maintaining a sense of belonging to the Malay community.

We are happy to announce that a sharing session between our RGS alumnae and current RGS Malay students took place on 8 March 2019, where our alumnae came back to share their experiences.

We would like to thank the following alumnae for making the session possible:
