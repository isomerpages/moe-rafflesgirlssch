<p>Words carry immense power as they shape our thoughts, stir emotions, and
leave a lasting impact. This year’s English Language (EL) Day invited students
and staff to explore the weight of words, both literally and figuratively.
From dressing up as literary characters to engaging in activities that
celebrated reading, writing, appreciation, and play, the day was a meaningful
exploration of language.</p>

<p>Students took part in Blind Date with a Book, selecting mystery reads
based on brief descriptions. They also tested their skills in Etymology
Hunt and Grammar Gems, and challenged their creativity in the Microfiction
Competition, where they crafted short stories around dilemmas. A highlight
of the day was a thought-provoking talk by Ms Peggy Pao Pei Yu, Executive
Director at MAS, who shared insights on the language of enforcement, offering
a fascinating look at how words wield authority and influence.</p>

<p>From creative costumes to compelling stories, EL Day 2025 was a powerful
reminder that words aren’t just letters on a page—they carry weight, and
sometimes, they even dress up for the occasion!</p>
