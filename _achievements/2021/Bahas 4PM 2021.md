## Bahas 4PM 2021

Organised by The Malay Youth Literary Association (4PM), Bahas 4PM is a national Malay-language debating competition which has been well received among the national oratorical competitions since 1993.

On 9 April 2021, our very own Srikandi Raffles - consisting of Arissa Kamaruzaman (308), Falisha Dina (308), Iman Nabilah Yasmeen (404), and Sherlita Almeyra (403) - managed to emerge as champions out of a pool of 16 teams for Bahas 4PM 2021 (Secondary Level).

From February until April, they underwent intense training sessions, and competed in the Preliminary, Quarter-Finals, Semi-Finals, and Finals in consecutive weeks. Eventually, they emerged as the grand champions after tough battles with many worthy opponents.

We would like to thank our teachers and alumni, Cikgu Nuraini, Cikgu Nadiah, Ms Murni, Ms Nazihah for their unwavering guidance and support throughout the competition as they helped the girls refine their speeches and hone their debating skills.
