_“The school song is the very first song a new pupil learns when she steps into RGS. It was officially introduced in 1954, after Principal Miss Hinchliffe (principal from 1951 - 1956) commissioned Miss Goodland, the music teacher, to introduce a school song. Miss Goodland selected the song ‘From High Olympus’ from a songbook called ‘Unison’ (a collection of songs sung during the British colonial days). The people responsible for the lyrics and tune were Miss Florence Hoare and Miss H.L. Schnoor.” - From RGS History Book – Daughters of a Better Age 1844-2006_

From High Olympus flows to us the glory, <br>
On us the sacred fire descends. <br>
Rise, sisters, rise, the world is all before ye. <br>
Fear not to grasp what fortune sends.

**Chorus**. <br>
Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, <br>
Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.

A little while the sun shines high above us, <br>
And youth's elixir fills our veins, <br>
The magic fire that moves the gods to love us, <br>
The fire by which the will attains.

**Chorus.** <br>
Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, <br>
Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.

So heart to heart, we'll scale the heights of learning, <br>
No mean desires our days shall shame, <br>
Whole-hearted, true, with pride and ardour burning <br>
On, sisters, on to life and fame.

**Chorus.** <br>
Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, <br>
Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.

_(a song composed in the early 1980’s by a talented group of girls who called themselves the Jasplys: comprising WL Chan, Lisa Tan, YS Tan, Susie See, Pauline Sng, ML Lui and Shirley Yee.)_

_“But when they talked about the song "Dedication", WHAM, the melody hit me – WITH THE LYRICS - and rang clearly in my head! For one reason or other, these words stuck with me through the years, impervious to my otherwise failing memory.” – An Alumnus_

_“A song that now lingers in my head…” – An Alumnus_

We have shared our morning days, <br>
And gone through all rainy nights, <br>
Even in the darkest of nights, <br>
Stars still light up our way.

Tomorrow is a beautiful dream, <br>
A dream that will be fulfilled, <br>
Cross the bridge of rainbow, <br>
In search of the gold.

For here we stand (for here we stand) <br>
Our dearest friend (our dearest friend) <br>
Sincerely from our hearts we wish, <br>
May streams of sunlight shine <br>
like rays of hope, <br>
Hand in hand, we work and strive <br>
For the best things in life.

#### 3) Filiae Melioris Aevi (composed by Caroline Sung, a choir pianist in the 1980s)

_“Mrs Chee Keng Soon (principal 1980-1988) fondly remembers this to be the favourite of the long-serving teacher in-charge of the choir, Mrs. Rathie Singam.” – RGS History Book – Daughters of a Better Age 1844-2006_

Now as we remember <br>
Strains of our school song <br>
Call to mind our motto <br>
Filiae Melioris Aevi

Filiae Melioris Aevi <br>
Daughters of a better age <br>
United by a common goal <br>
Filiae Melioris Aevi

#### 4) Gaudeamus igitur \[Lyrics by C.W. Kindeleben\]

_“is a popular song in educational institutions, mostly at university graduations. I believe that it was sung in RGS before the School Song was written. My most vivid memory of the song is when it was sung in the film "Student Prince" set at the University of Heidelberg.” - Mrs Carmee Lim (Principal 1988-1999)_
