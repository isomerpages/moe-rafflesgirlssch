## How ICT Will Be Used in RGS

ICT will be used in RGS during class time and beyond to:

**1 \.**       **Activate Learning**

*   Students access different types of media – text, videos, images, models, simulations, animations
*   Students are oriented towards the learning objectives either before a lesson at home or at the start of a lesson in class
*   Teachers can make lesson materials available online through online platforms such as Edmodo or the RGS Google Domain
*   Teachers can conduct a survey or put up an online quiz to gather information on prior knowledge on a topic they are about to start teaching
*   Teachers can provide task environments that represent and simulate real-world problems, situations and contexts
-Micro-worlds and simulations<br>
-Virtual/augmented reality<br>
-Role-play simulations
*   Students have access to online libraries, databases and search engines and can learn independently or be directed to specific sources by their teachers
*   Students can communicate with the teacher online to inform on what they have already learned, and what they would like to know more about even before a lesson starts
*   Students set goals and targets and organise their own learning (e.g. wikis, blogs, online calendars, email)
