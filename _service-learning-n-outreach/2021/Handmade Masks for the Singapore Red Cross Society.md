## Handmade Masks for the Singapore Red Cross Society

As part of a class-initiated Values-in-Action (VIA) activity, RGS students from class 112, mentored by their form teacher Mr Chua Han Hui, embarked on a '112 sews 72!' initiative to hand-make 72 face masks for the Singapore Red Cross Society. The masks will be sold by the Society to raise funds for its local services, including COVID-19 relief for vulnerable communities in Singapore.

_"Our participation in this VIA activity taught us the spirit of never giving up when the going gets tough. We also had a good lesson in resilience and responsibility over the past few months, with some of our classmates stepping up to help and teach those who don't know how to sew the masks so that everyone can play a part in this initiative. Thank you too to the Singapore Red Cross Society for the opportunity for us to give back to the community!"
