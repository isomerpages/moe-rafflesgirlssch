## Founder's Day 2021

<img src="/images/FD 37.png" style="width:85%">

On 30th July, RGS celebrated her 142nd Founder's Day. In light of the Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), variousÂ safetyÂ measures were put in place. With the support of everyone involved, the celebrations were carried out with our very own RGS touch! We were honoured to have Justice Judith Prakash (Chairperson, RGS Board of Governors, 1995 to 2020) as the guest-of-honour and Justice Mavis Chionh (Chairperson, RGS Board of Governors, 2021 to date) to grace the event via the webinar.

Founder's Day is a longstanding RGS tradition that honours effort, aspiration and stewardship of potential; a celebration of the schoolâ€™s 142nd birthday and the collective hopes for the school in the coming years. It is indeed a significant day that brings everyone together!

This year, the theme of Founder's Day is "Different Stories, One Heartbeat". It serves to encapsulate the idea that regardless of differences in backgrounds and dreams, the RGS identity remains deeply rooted in every single Rafflesian even as each one of us writes our own unique story.

In addition, the RGS Heritage Trail was officially launched during the celebrations! The trail aims to bring the history of the school to life via a myriad of artefacts strategically installed around the campus. The trail serves also as a concrete reminder of the school's humble beginnings and its mission to nurture Daughters of a Better Age.
