The Historical Scene Investigation (H.S.I.) Challenge is an annual contest organised by the National Library Board, which promises an exciting experience for students to put their historical inquiry and research skills to the test.&nbsp;This year’s contest focused on Singapore’s&nbsp;road to independence between 1945 and 1965. Students chronicled the lives of&nbsp;Singaporeans during that time, stating the events that had a profound impact on the&nbsp;population.&nbsp;
