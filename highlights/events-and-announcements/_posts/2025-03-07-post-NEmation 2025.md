<p>Held annually, N.E.mation! is a national digital animation competition
organised by Defence Collective Singapore (DCS) in partnership with Nexus.
The competition encourages youths to unleash their creativity in expressing
their thoughts on Total Defence (TD) and aims to inspire Singaporeans to
put Total Defence into action.</p>
<p>Students had the opportunity to learn from workshops that introduced them
to the fundamentals of animation. Additionally, they gained valuable skills
in project management and teamwork.</p>
<p>This year, five student teams from RGS qualified as finalists in the student
category. Team SmoothlikePluffle received a Special Mention, while Team
MISS was crowned Champion.</p>
