<p><strong><em>The RGS Library is a distinctive symbol of the school’s commitment towards acquiring knowledge, learning and research. Behind every great community is a great library.</em></strong>
</p>
<p>The mission of the RGS Library is to encourage reading, embolden learning
and enable research through resourcing, collaboration and engagement. The
library’s vision is to be a hub of intellectual inquiry and a library for
all. A meaningful space to connect with knowledge and with one another.</p>
<p>Our library offers a welcoming and supportive 21st century learning environment.
We are committed to ensuring that our school community remains competent
and ethical users of information while pursuing their strong intellectual
curiosity and a life-long love of reading, learning, and self-directed
thinking.</p>
