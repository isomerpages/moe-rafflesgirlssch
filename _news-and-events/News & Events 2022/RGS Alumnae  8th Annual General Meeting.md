The RGSA is a much-valued member of the RGS community, engaging us through their public education programmes; philanthropic activities and inspiring webinars; as well as sharing their experiences, providing mentorships and internships as well as connecting with their younger sisters-in-learning in myriad, meaningful ways.

We congratulate Ms Lee Twe Jeog and Ms Mabel Tay as they continue to helm the Association in their role as President and Vice-president respectively. 

As before, we look forward to partnering the RGS Alumnae 4th Executive Council to fulfil the School’s and Alumnae’s mission of nurturing daughters of a better age.
