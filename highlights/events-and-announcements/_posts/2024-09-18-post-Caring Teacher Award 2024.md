<p>We are delighted to share that our Mathematics teacher, Mdm Ng Peck Wee,
has been&nbsp;awarded the Caring Teacher Awards (CTA) 2024. She is one
of only three teachers to receive this prestigious National Level Award.</p>
<p>This year’s CTA theme, ‘Instilling a Caring Culture,’ reflects the programme’s
mission to honour educators who go above and beyond the call of duty to
nurture the holistic development of their students. Organised by NIE NTU
and supported by MOE, the 2024 awards garnered an impressive 12,984 nominations
from 259 schools. After a rigorous evaluation, three teachers were recognised
with the National Level Award and seven received the National Commendation
Award.</p>
<p>Mdm Ng's dedication to her students' well-being, alongside her efforts
to guide them through both their academic and personal challenges, has
earned her this remarkable recognition.</p>
<p>“I teach with care, compassion, empathy, and sincerity. Every student
matters to me, irrespective of their abilities or background, as I firmly
believe that within each child lies a precious gem waiting to shine. Together,
we embark on a journey of growth, discovery, and endless possibilities,
enriching both their lives and mine." - Mdm Ng Peck Wee</p>
<p>Congratulations, Mdm Ng!</p>
