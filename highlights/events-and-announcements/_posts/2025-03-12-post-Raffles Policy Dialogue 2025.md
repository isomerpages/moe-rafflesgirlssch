<p>How do we define success? What does it truly mean to ‘make it’ in Singapore?
These were some of the thought-provoking questions explored at this year’s
Raffles Policy Dialogue (RPD), where over 700 students from 45 schools
gathered to exchange ideas and challenge perspectives.</p>

<p>This year’s theme—Redefining Success in Singapore—builds on last year’s
In-Conversation and continues our journey of exploring Singapore’s evolving
aspirations. Through insightful discussions, students deepened their understanding
of the multi-faceted nature of success while also forging new friendships
across schools.</p>
<p>Guiding our conversations were Ms Jeanne Liew (Principal, Republic Polytechnic),
Mr Josephus Tan (pro bono criminal justice lawyer), and Ms Chew Wei Shan,
also known as Weish (multidisciplinary artist), who brought diverse perspectives
on education, justice, and the arts.</p>
<p>Since 2024, RPD has been co-organised by students from Raffles Girls’
School, Beatty Secondary School, and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School,
making this a truly collaborative effort. A huge thank you to our panellists,
participants, and student organisers for making RPD 2025 a meaningful and
engaging experience!</p>
