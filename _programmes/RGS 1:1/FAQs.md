<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h4>What are the education benefits of a 1:1 programme?</h4>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>1:1 programmes extend learning beyond the classroom. With the ability
to gather vast amounts of information from the Internet and new media,
learning becomes multi-modal and more self-directed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Networking opportunities extend learning to include peers, parents, siblings
and experts outside the school; making learning a collaborative experience
while maintaining the individuality of each girl</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students who own their own ICT devices are found to take greater pride
and ownership over the knowledge they create, with a flow-on to more flexible
forms of schooling</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning takes place anytime, anywhere</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students can learn experientially how the various disciplines use technology.
Thinking like a scientist, for example, must include learning how technology
is used to gather and analyse data</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Will the use of ICT improve my daughter's academic results?</h4>
<p>Research, including that of PISA 2015, has shown that there are modest
gains in academic performance as a result of increased usage of ICT for
teaching and learning. Given the profile of our students – highly-able
and motivated – their academic results are not expected to improve solely
because of increased ICT usage. What they will achieve is the ability to
function in a world where technology plays a big part of everyday life.</p>
<h4>How often will the device be used in class? Will it be used for all subjects?</h4>
<p>All subject teachers are expected to use the device for teaching and learning.
They are required to set learning tasks for at least 30% of curriculum
hours. Usage is dependent on the nature of the subject. For example, students
would use ICT less for PE than for Science.</p>
<h4>How will the device be used during lessons?</h4>
<p>The device will be used for</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Creative expression</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Establishing prior knowledge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assessment - formative and summative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Research</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Communication</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaboration</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Will my daughter be distracted from learning?</h4>
<p>The school will do its best to monitor student usage to prevent abuse.
Teachers in Years 1 and 2 will be using Apple Classroom to manage and monitor
learning with the iPad while the students are in class. Every student will
be informed about an Acceptable Use Policy. However, the school encourages
personal responsibility and seeks the cooperation of parents in monitoring
their children.</p>
<h4>Will the use of ICT affect handwriting?</h4>
<p>The need for students to write legibly will not be eliminated. Most assessments
will still be pen-and-paper-based.</p>
<h4>Will my daughter's eyesight be negatively affected through excessive use of the computer?</h4>
<p>Students will not be working on the device throughout the day. They will
be engaged in face-to-face interactions for most of the time during each
lesson. Students will also be educated on the appropriate usage including
ways of minimising negative effects on health.</p>
<h4>How will the school ensure Internet safety?</h4>
<p>While specific undesirable sites are blocked for Internet usage in school,
Internet safety is a collaborative effort between students, teachers and
parents. Teachers can monitor student activity during class time but usage
in between lessons and after school would require onsite monitoring to
ensure that students are mainly focused on learning while using their personal
learning devices.</p>
<h4>Is the charging of student iPad allowed in school?</h4>
<p>As there are limited charging points in the classrooms and also charging
stations in school, students are expected to come to school with a fully-charged
iPad. Students are also expected to use their own charging cables at the
charging stations in school.</p>
<h4>Do we have to buy the iPad, Apple Pencil and keyboard on our own?</h4>
<p>MOE has managed to acquire a bundle deal for students' purchase. More
information is available on the Year 1 Registration website&nbsp;(via our
RGS iNet portal) on&nbsp;<strong>23 December 2024</strong>.</p>
