Visit our 2022 Open House at [www.rgs.edu.sg/rgsoh2022](http://www.rgs.edu.sg/rgsoh2022) from **20 May to 10 June 2022**!  
  
You don't have to register for this virtual visit. All are welcome!  
  
Besides learning more about RGS and the Raffles Programme, you can watch videos to get a 'glimpse' of school activities and events, and 'feel' the school culture and hear what the staff and students have to say about their experiences in RGS. Also, go on a virtual 360 school tour of our Campus!
