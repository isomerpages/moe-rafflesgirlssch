## School Symbols

#### School Crest and Motto

<img src="/images/school-crest.jpg" style="width:49%" align="right">

The colours of the school crest are the standard colours of the House of Sir Stamford Raffles: Green, White and Black. The open book symbolises knowledge and the burning torch our commitment to forge character and develop life skills.  
  
The school's motto, Filiae Melioris Aevi, emblazoned across the crest, is Latin for Daughters of a Better Age. It is our pledge to the community that girls who pass through the portals of RGS will not simply inherit a fine tradition but will actively forge a finer future for her community.

#### The Raffles Tree

The Raffles Tree is a bronze sculpture by local sculptor Brother Joseph McNally. This symbol of RGS is located at the foyer of the Arrival Plaza of the school. It is a symbolic representation of the fruition of our students' potential.  
  
The four main spirals represent the school's four corporate values, People-Centred, Principled, Passionate and Professional, which provide a firm foundation for the school community.  
  
The birds in a playful mood reflect the true spirit of learning, which is one of exploration, freedom and enjoyment. The roots of the tree signify how RGS remains firmly planted in the nation's rich multi-cultural heritage and the school's tradition.

#### The Rafflesian Creed

We, the pupils of RGS, pledge to <br>
uphold integrity in our actions, <br>
to face all challenges with passion and endurance, to serve our <br>
community with compassion and to the best of our ability and in <br>
doing so, honour the school history and motto, Filiae Melioris Aevi.
