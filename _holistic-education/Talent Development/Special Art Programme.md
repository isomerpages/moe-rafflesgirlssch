## Special Art Programme

The Special Art Programme is designed to provide an enriched Art curriculum that is meaningful, relates to the experiences of our students, and capitalises on their imagination. It strives to create a balance between the concepts and processes of Art, with a student-centred approach. The programme seeks to develop curiosity through discipline-based Art education and enables our students to look at issues with a critical eye. They will be able to construct meaning from their experiences and translate that into creative expressions.
