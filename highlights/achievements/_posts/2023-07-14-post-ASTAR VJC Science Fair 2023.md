**Reflection by Alvina, Ranice & Tessa**

*"This experience was an enriching one, albeit rigorous. We had been preparing for it since the June holidays and it was truly worth it. Through this experience, we have learnt both research and soft skills, and we are very proud to have been able to participate in this prestigious competition.‚Äù*

**Reflection by Cheryl, Kit-Ann & Mallikasree**

*"The VJC A\*STAR science fair was a memorable experience. As our first time doing research, this competition allowed us to hone our communication skills in presenting complex ideas and helped us develop resilience. The research process also nurtured our passion for science and trained our scientific inquiry skills."*
