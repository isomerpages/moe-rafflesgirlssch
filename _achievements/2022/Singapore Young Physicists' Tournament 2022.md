As host of the SYPT this year, on top of mentoring their students, our team of Physics teachers also took on the responsibilities of planning and running the event, in partnership with the Ministry of Education, DSO National Laboratories and Institute of Physics Singapore.  
  
Congratulations to the teams, the teachers and student helpers for a job well done!

SYPT seeks to bring students through a process of what physicists do, from research to modelling, experimentation and finally to an oral defence before peers and experts. It provides authentic learning experiences in the learning of physics. Participants of the SYPT stand to represent Singapore in the International Young Physicists' Tournament. Traditionally held as a face-to-face competition, changes to the format of the tournament was made to adhere to prevailing safe management measures, where teams have to go through a full day of challenges held via Zoom.
