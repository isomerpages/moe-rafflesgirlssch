## Welcome

RGS is blessed with wonderful parents who are strong advocates of partnership between parents
and the school. The Parents for RGS Association (PRGS) is a registered society established since 26
February 2003, although the parents' volunteer group at RGS has been active for more than a
decade before that.

PRGS works closely with the school to provide a support network for parents/guardians of RGS students, and organise activities to allow our members to develop and maintain links with the school. This legacy of close partnership and collaboration between PRGS and the school has enabled us to tap on the skills and expertise of these parents to provide a rich school experience for our girls.

If you would like to play an active and involved role in PRGS's events and activities, do email &nbsp;[prgs@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg](mailto:prgs@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg).
