<p>How do we define success? What does it truly mean to ‘make it’ in Singapore?
These were some of the thought-provoking questions explored at this year’s&nbsp;<em>Raffles Policy Dialogue (RPD)</em>,
where over&nbsp;700 students from 45 schools gathered to exchange ideas
and challenge perspectives.</p>
<p>One key question that resonated with many participants:&nbsp;How can we
broaden our definition of success beyond grades and academic achievements?&nbsp;
Discussions centred on shifting mindsets, embracing diverse strengths,
and reimagining success in a way that reflects Singapore’s evolving aspirations.</p>

<p>This year’s theme—<em>Redefining Success in Singapore</em>—builds on last
year’s&nbsp;<em>In-Conversation</em>&nbsp;and continues our journey of
exploring Singapore’s evolving aspirations. Through insightful discussions,
students deepened their understanding of the&nbsp;multi-faceted nature
of success&nbsp;while also forging new friendships across schools.</p>
<p>Guiding our conversations were&nbsp;Ms Jeanne Liew&nbsp;(Principal, Republic
Polytechnic),&nbsp;Mr Josephus Tan&nbsp;(pro bono criminal justice lawyer),
and&nbsp;Ms Chew Wei Shan&nbsp;(multidisciplinary artist), who brought
diverse perspectives on education, justice, and the arts.</p>
<p>Since 2024, RPD has been&nbsp;co-organised by students from Raffles Girls’
School, Beatty Secondary School, and Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School,
making this a truly collaborative effort. A huge thank you to our panellists,
participants, and student organisers for making RPD 2025 a meaningful and
engaging experience!</p>
