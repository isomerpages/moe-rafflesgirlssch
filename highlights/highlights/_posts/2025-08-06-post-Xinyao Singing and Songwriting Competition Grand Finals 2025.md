<p>Our girls took part in the 2025 “Xin Kong Xia” Xinyao Singing and Songwriting
Competition, a national platform that celebrates the beauty of the Chinese
language through heartfelt lyrics and original melodies.</p>
<p>Organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning and partners,
this annual competition invites students to express themselves through
original compositions and performances in the spirit of Xinyao, a uniquely
Singaporean genre rooted in storytelling, reflection, and heart.</p>
<p>Zhang Xiya Viona (Year 4) received the Merit Award in the Individual Lyrics
Writing category with her heartfelt piece 《最后一堂课》(The Last Lesson), a moving
reflection on parting and growth.</p>
<p>In the Creative Songwriting Category, Lee Lin Shan Christine (Year 4)
and Wang Zihan (Year 4) clinched 2nd Place (Runner-Up) for their original
song《匆匆》(Transient Days), which explores the fleeting beauty of youth,
inspired by themes from the Chinese literature syllabus.</p>
