<li>
<p><strong>Is there an orientation programme for Secondary 1s? If so, when will it be and what will happen then?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an orientation programme for all Secondary 1 students. (In RGS,
we refer to these students as ‘Year 1s’ as they are in ‘Year 1’ of the
6-year Raffles Programme). The 4-day Orientation Programme in RGS begins
on Thursday 2 Jan 2025 and will end on Tuesday 7 Jan 2025. More details
will be provided later via Parents Gateway.&nbsp;</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p><strong>I cannot decide whether to take up a Third Language or a Special Programme. Is it possible for me to register for a Third Language and also interview for a Special Programme to keep my options open?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is strongly recommended that students consider their options carefully
and adhere to the deadlines to submit their choices. In RGS, <strong>it is not possible to take both a Third Language AND a Special Programme</strong> as
our timetable is planned in such a way that lessons for these programmes
are scheduled on the same day; i.e. on Friday afternoons. Thus, your daughter
cannot be in two programmes at the same time.</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p><strong>What are the Special Programmes offered in RGS and what are the pre-requisites for application?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Information on these <strong>Special</strong> Programmes can be found on
our school’s website and more details are also shared on RGS Y1 Registration
site. You are strongly encouraged to go through the detailed information
on the website and not to miss the application deadlines.</p>
<p></p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<p><strong>How many CCAs can a student take up?</strong>
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In RGS, all students take up <strong><u>only one CCA</u></strong>. This
is to ensure that all students have a well-balanced RGS experience where
they can also make time for other learning opportunities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On average, every CCA has activities on at least two days of the week
and the designated CCA days are Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. Therefore,
students are unable to take up more than one CCA as the CCAs occur at the
same time.&nbsp;</p>
