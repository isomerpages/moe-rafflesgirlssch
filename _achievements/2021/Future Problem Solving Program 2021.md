In CmPS, teams identify and solve current problems in their own communities. This experience builds hands-on problem-solving skills, strengthens analytical skills and leadership ability and offers many different types of communication opportunities, all while actively involving students in giving back to the community in which they live.  
  
Find out more about each team's project from the write-ups below.  
  
**Project Mindflayer** advocates against cyberbullying against youths aged 13 to 17 in Singapore. Cyberbullying is an issue that is becoming increasingly prevalent in Singapore, with three in four youths being affected by it. In recent times, the global pandemic has forced structural changes in their learning environment and our youths have become more vulnerable to cyberbullying with increased curriculum and studying time spent online. This project aims to empower youths, both victims and bystanders, to take a stand against cyberbullying and deal with it appropriately and safely. Through its initiatives, the team hopes to increase the number of youths who are proactive and confident in deterring cyberbullying, so as to promote and establish a safer online environment for students in Singapore schools in the year 2020 and beyond.

**Project deVICE** advocates for the cultivation of healthy device usage habits in children aged 5-9. In normal times, the risk of addiction to electronic devices is high. The unprecedented onset of COVID-19 that resulted in quarantine measures has increased the likelihood of children growing increasingly reliant on their devices especially with the implementation of Home-Based Learning (HBL). Parents also heavily rely on devices to entertain their restless children at home. Hence, Project deVICE has found it imperative to continue with their project so that the team would be able to alert parents and caregivers to the danger of device addiction.

**Project ImPETus** aims to cultivate a responsible mindset towards animal welfare in the community on the significance of responsible pet ownership and to see people actively cultivate responsible pet ownership habits in order to lower pet abandonment. The team plans to target the general population because there should not be a demographic bias for cultivating habits for pet ownership, but more efforts will be targeted at young and impressionable youths who are mature enough to understand, cultivate and practice responsible pet ownership.
