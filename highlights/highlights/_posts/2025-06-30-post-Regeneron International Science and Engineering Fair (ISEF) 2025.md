<p>Following the competition, the students reflected on their experience:</p>
<p>“Reflecting on the experience at Regeneron ISEF 2025, we are incredibly
grateful for the opportunity to represent Singapore on a global stage.
Engaging with global researchers showed us that STEM is not just about
innovation, but about asking better questions — ones that challenge assumptions
and drive meaningful change. The experience was both humbling and inspiring,
and we are thankful for the unwavering support of our mentors, teachers,
family and friends who made this journey possible.”</p>
