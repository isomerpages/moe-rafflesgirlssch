<p>As we commemorate Total Defence Day 2025, we are reminded that readiness
and resilience are key to overcoming challenges. Total Defence underpins
Singapore’s ability to respond to ever-evolving threats, and everyone has
a role to play in ensuring that our nation remains strong.</p>
<p>As part of our school’s commemoration of Total Defence Day, our Uniformed
Groups introduced Year 1 students to the six pillars of Total Defence through
engaging activities, helping them understand how each aspect contributes
to Singapore’s preparedness. Through these activities, the Year 1s also
reflected on their role in upholding each pillar, from fostering strong
social bonds to staying vigilant against threats. In addition, the canteen
served a simplified menu to simulate the constraints of limited ingredients
during a crisis, reinforcing the importance of adaptability and resourcefulness.</p>
<p>Every action, no matter how small, contributes to a resilient Singapore.
Together, we keep Singapore strong.</p>
