<p>Over the years, our students have actively contributed to the well-being
of the local community, engaging in meaningful service that extends beyond
the classroom. As part of Learning Journeys (LJ) Week, our Year 1s were
introduced to Service-Learning through the What’s in My Backyard initiative—a
programme designed to deepen their understanding of the community, particularly
the elderly, and to nurture a sense of empathy and responsibility as active
citizens.</p>

<p>Our girls had the invaluable opportunity to interact with residents across
various neighbourhoods, including Braddell-Toa Payoh, Commonwealth, Tanglin
Halt, Margaret Drive, and Marsiling. Working in partnership with long-standing
community organisations such as:</p>

<p>Through hands-on activities, the girls contributed in various ways, including
home cleaning for seniors to support their living conditions and organising
mini carnivals or arts and crafts that engaged the residents. They fostered
empathy by interacting with the seniors and dialysis patients, learning
about their lived experiences and the challenges they face.</p>
<p>We were also heartened by the involvement of our parent volunteers, who
played a vital role in chaperoning and supporting the students. Many parents
joined in the home cleaning efforts, working alongside their children to
uplift the lives of seniors in the community.</p>
<p>Back on campus, students turned their focus to appreciating members of
our school community—particularly our school cleaners. They stepped into
their shoes by taking part in daily cleaning routines, which included tidying
up their own classrooms, their seniors’ classrooms, and key shared facilities
such as the Library, School Canteen, and toilets across the campus. Through
these acts of service, students cultivated a deeper appreciation for those
who work tirelessly behind the scenes to maintain a clean and conducive
learning environment.</p>
<p>These experiences serve as an early and impactful stepping stone in our
students’ journey towards becoming Daughters of a Better Age—young individuals
committed to uplifting others with empathy, purpose, and a heart for the
community.</p>
