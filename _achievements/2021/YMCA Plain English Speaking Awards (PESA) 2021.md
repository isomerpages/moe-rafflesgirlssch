## YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA) 2021

The YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards (PESA) 2021 is a national competition organised by YMCA of Singapore, in partnership with the Ministry of Education and the Speak Good English Movement. Happening annually, PESA promotes public speaking in Plain English and provides a platform for students to hone their oratorical skills and cultivate confidence in public speaking.   

After a hiatus last year due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, PESA re-emerged this year with all its rounds taking place virtually in light of the ongoing pandemic. RGS fielded six students to participate in the competition—three for the lower secondary category and three for the upper secondary category. 

Under the guidance of RGS teacher-coaches (Mr Alwin Ho, Ms Daphne Chua and Ms Sharon Ong) , the students attained the school’s best performance in PESA in more than five years!
