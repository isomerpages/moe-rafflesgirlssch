<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Admission to RGS is offered at two entry points — Year 1 and Year 3. The
following sections outline the various admission pathways and relevant
details for prospective students.</p>
<p><strong>The Integrated Programme is a six-year programme. Students are expected to fulfil their commitment to the school for the full duration, and transfers to other schools are strongly discouraged. In particular, transfers to other IP schools are not allowed, unless under exceptional circumstances.</strong>
</p>
<h4>Admission to Year 1 – Direct School Admission (DSA)</h4>
<p>Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides
students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school,
based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements
and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE).</p>
<p>Primary 6 (P6) students who do not participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise
will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE results through the
Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise.</p>
<p>Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on
the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic
and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop
the area of talent.</p>
<p>Female Singaporean, Singapore PR and International Students who possess
talents and achievements in a specific academic subject, a sport, music,
visual art or demonstrate leadership in serving the school/community &nbsp;are
encouraged to apply for admission to RGS from May to June annually.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise</strong>
</p>
<p>The annual S1 Posting Exercise is conducted by the Ministry of Education
(MOE) to post Primary Six (P6) students from our mainstream schools who
have passed their Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) to a secondary
school taking into consideration their PSLE results, choice of schools
and available vacancies.</p>
<p><strong>Appeal for School Transfer after Secondary 1 (S1) Posting</strong>
</p>
<p>The appeal for School Transfer after Secondary 1 (S1) Posting&nbsp;will
take place after the MOE S1 Posting.</p>
<p>Posting and application for transfer takes place annually in December.</p>
<p>Primary 6 female students in the local mainstream schools who have participated
in the MOE S1 Posting Exercise, may appeal to be considered for transfer
to RGS. Students who appeal for transfer must meet the school's cut-off
point for that year, and admission of such students is subjected to available
vacancies.</p>
<p>NOTE: Students who have already gained admission into a secondary school
via DSA or AEIS are not allowed to participate in the S1 Posting Exercise
and Appeal for School Transfer after Secondary 1 (S1) Posting.</p>
