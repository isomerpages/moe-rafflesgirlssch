<p>Decked out in our House colours, we brought the Rafflesian Spirit to Serangoon
Stadium this morning for our annual Sports Fest! The RGS Sports Fest aims
to promote house and school spirit, foster respect, friendship, and excellence
through teamwork, and provide opportunities for active participation in
sports and games. These qualities were clearly demonstrated throughout
the day.</p>
<p>Despite the drizzle, the Rafflesian community was all set to end the term
with a blast, filled with non-stop fun activities for everyone! A special
shout-out goes to the Parents for RGS (PRGS) for their amazing snack packs,
specially designed sports towels, and unwavering support throughout the
event. Your contribution made all the difference, and we’re grateful for
your generosity! Thank you <a href="https://www.facebook.com/rgsparents?__cft__[0]=AZUTw9WfvUv3JAVoPC1J803kv7y2IBdzCkzW2gQ1FOUV_2Uh4_8iF9iUKyEIdyzPdCdDf_N8QnTEcPNvkblXrS729xKn35WOk0oSNCId24yCeNAMLFBvdD8dV0gjPIhHvWYxT6PWJwpbEwnPonsHIYrzp76T1T9FU2acUBd_ccbhd9O5whZkRdYfcgoqefjrjvkIs9GI9nwgDiA9Q7zTUSpq&amp;__tn__=-]K-R" class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x1ejq31n xd10rxx x1sy0etr x17r0tee x972fbf xcfux6l x1qhh985 xm0m39n x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz x1sur9pj xkrqix3 x1fey0fg xo1l8bm" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Parents for RGS Association (PRGS)</a>!</p>
