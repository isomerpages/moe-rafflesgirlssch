We concluded term 1 on a high note with exciting and experiential Learning Journeys and Regional Immersion and Community Exploration (RICE) trips for all our girls. 

Our students participated in a variety of activities such as volunteering to clean homes for the elderly and interacting with them through service learning (Year 1s), exploring a kampung (Malay village) in Malaysia and places of worship in Singapore as part of RICE (Year 2s). Other students learnt about the importance of sustainability in Singapore through a visit to Gardens by the Bay (Year 3s), and gained insights into the challenges faced by Singapore's air hub and how Singapore overcame it (Year 4s). 

At RGS, LJ and RICE week is a crucial aspect of our Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) programme, providing immersive learning experiences beyond the classroom. We are thrilled that our girls were able to have an even more enriching LJ and RICE experience this year.
