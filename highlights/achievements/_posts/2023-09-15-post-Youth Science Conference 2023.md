The Youth Science Conference (YSC) is an annual event organised by the Gifted Education Branch, MOE, for students involved in scientific research under either the Science Mentorship Programme (SMP) or the School-Based Science Mentorship Programme (SB-SMP).

The 29th YSC was held on Friday, 15 September at Nanyang Polytechnic. The conference showcased 8 SMP and 17 SB-SMP projects from RGS. We extend our heartfelt congratulations to our teams for their outstanding performance!  Click [here](/files/29th%20ysc%20results.pdf) to view the results of our projects.
