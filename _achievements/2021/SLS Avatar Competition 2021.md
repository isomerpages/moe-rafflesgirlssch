## SLS Avatar Competition 2021

From 4 October - 26 November 2021, the Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) held the SLS Avatar competition, inviting students to submit an avatar of their design. The winning entries would be used as avatar choices for all SLS users.

There were more than 8,500 entries from students across Singapore and we are proud to share that RGS Year 2 student Fiona Guan Xue Hui’s submission was selected as one of the winning entries.  

If you’re an SLS user, do consider using her avatar design!
