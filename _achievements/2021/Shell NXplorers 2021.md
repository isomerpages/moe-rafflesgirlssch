## Shell NXplorers 2021

Shell NXplorers 2021 is championed by Science Centre Singapore and Shell Singapore. It is a platform for young people to develop sustainable solutions to food, water and energy challenges. Through the process, students learn systems thinking, scenario planning, and develop change management skills - all highly relevant skill sets that inspire and equip students to be positive agents of change. 

Targeted at Secondary School students, this year’s programme drew a strong response – with 127 team registrations from 52 schools in Jan 2021. Over the course of six months involving workshops, competition entries and project sharing, 10 outstanding teams were shortlisted as finalists. Under the guidance of our RGS teacher-mentors, all four of the RGS registered teams were shortlisted for the final judging, and the following are the teams’ achievements:

Just as in 2020, Shell NXplorers 2021 Finals Judging took place virtually on 6 August in lieu of safe distancing measures and was live streamed via the Facebook page of STEM Inc, Science Centre Singapore. The event was graced by the Science Centre Singapore's Chief Executive, Assoc Prof Lim Tit Meng as well as Shell's Head of Corporate Relations Southeast Asia, Mr Sahala Sianipar. Teams were given 10 minute for their project presentation followed by a 5 minute Q&A session with the judges, namely, Mr Loh Seng Yee (VP Sales Asia Pacific, Shell Catalyst and Technologies Pte Ltd), Mr Danny Chua (Managing Director, CYC Pte Ltd) and Mr Vincent Lau (Chief Technology Officer, Pylon City). 

Congratulations to all the teams and teacher-mentors for their excellent work in the competition!
