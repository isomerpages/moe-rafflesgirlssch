The Raffles Programme is a seamless 6-year curriculum culminating in the Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate in Education (GCE) Advanced Level Examination.  
  
Building on the rich heritage and culture of excellence of Raffles Girls' School and Raffles Institution, the programme provides a rigorous and enriched curriculum for highly-able students in Singapore. The Raffles Programme offers a broad-based curriculum, pathways for the development of special interests and strengths, and an emphasis on character and leadership development.

#### Our Mission  

Nurturing the high ability girl to be a leader who will realise her talents in service of nation and community.

#### Goals

To develop fine character and well-being, nurture the intellect and fire the imagination of the RGS girl as a 

*   **Person** who is purposeful and aspires towards the greater good with integrity, empathy and resilience.
*   **Leader** who values diversity, cohesiveness, and inclusiveness in exerting positive influence and impact on the community.
*   **Thinker** who demonstrates a disposition for reflective and flexible thinking, and is willing to take intellectual risks, especially in the face of complex and ambiguous situations.
*   **Pioneer** who seeks opportunities and embraces challenges with courage to innovate for the common good.

#### School Values  

People-centred, Principled, Passionate, Professional

#### Our Curriculum Framework  

The Raffles Programme is based on the principles of the Integrated Curriculum Model for gifted learners (Van Tassel-Baska, 1986). The curriculum challenges highly able students through the use of advanced content knowledge, high-order process and product work, and cross-disciplinary concept development.

#### Raffles Approaches to Foster Learning  

The Raffles classroom fosters a passion for lifelong learning through the following approaches:

*   Authentic: Draws on real-world knowledge of local and global contexts
*   Learner-centred: Encourages active participation, exploration, discovery and collaboration among learners
*   Process-focused: Emphasises ways of thinking and the development of disciplinary skills in the various fields
*   Integrative: Builds on the inter-connectedness of ideas across disciplines

#### Assessment

Assessment modes are varied and emphasise content mastery and process skills. Continual assessment is a central feature of the assessment framework. Both assessment of learning and assessment for learning are emphasised. Assessment tools include:

*   Standardised pen and paper tests
*   Performance tasks and journals
*   Portfolios
*   Oral presentations
*   Individual and group projects

#### Curriculum and Instructional Design Tools

The Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM) is an integrative approach of organising and differentiating the curriculum for gifted learners through three different dimensions:

*   Advanced content
*   Interdisciplinary concepts/themes/issues
*   High level process-product development

It is designed to respond to the precocity, intensity and complexity that characterise highly able learners.
