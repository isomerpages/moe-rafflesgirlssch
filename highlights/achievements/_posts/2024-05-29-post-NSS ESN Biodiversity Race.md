<p>Our students from TheWildSide, Cogitaire, and other passionate RGS girls
recently showcased their enthusiasm and skills in the 3rd NSS ESN Biodiversity
Race on 29 May. This exciting event saw participation from 40 teams representing
12 primary and secondary schools across six locations on the island. Their
mission was to record research-grade observations of various species, including
amphibians, birds, butterflies, moths, mammals, and reptiles. The participants
collectively recorded an impressive total of 929 observations, covering
121 different species.</p>
