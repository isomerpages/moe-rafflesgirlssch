<p>Our school came alive with vibrant colours and joy as we celebrated the
Festival of Lights. The Ethnic Dance CCA captivated everyone with their
stunning performances, filling the hall with rhythm and energy.</p>

<p>In the spirit of festivity and giving, our RGS Congress organised a Deepavali
donation drive, distributing celebration packs and appreciation notes to
our unsung heroes from the Estate Crew and Cleaning Ladies, who work tirelessly
to maintain a clean and conducive school environment for us.</p>
<p>This gesture was a small token of our gratitude and appreciation for their
ongoing efforts. A heartfelt thank you to our dedicated staff and students
for organising this meaningful celebration, filled with performances and
interactive activities that allowed everyone to deepen their understanding
of Deepavali traditions and the powerful message of light overcoming darkness.</p>
