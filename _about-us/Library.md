***The RGS Library is a distinctive symbol of the school’s commitment towards acquiring knowledge, learning and research. Behind every great community is a great library.***

The mission of the RGS Library is to encourage reading, embolden learning and enable research through resourcing, collaboration and engagement. The library’s vision is to be a hub of intellectual inquiry and a library for all. A meaningful space to connect with knowledge and with one another.

Our library offers a welcoming and supportive 21st century learning environment. We are committed to ensuring that our school community remains competent and ethical users of information while pursuing their strong intellectual curiosity and a life-long love of reading, learning, and self-directed thinking.
