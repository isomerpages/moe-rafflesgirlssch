## English Language

#### Our Philosophy

The study of the English Language recognises that language is a communicative tool which transmits values and culture and it is a medium for the development of aesthetic sensibility. The acquisition of English Language competency would enable the individual to make informed judgments about moral, philosophical and social issues, as well as to be an effective communicator in private and public discourse. Language develops an awareness of the self in relation to the diversity of human experience and it is a powerful tool for personal thought, expression and the development of thinkers, leaders and pioneers, as well as for advocacy.

#### Our Aspirations for Every RGS English Language Student

At RGS, the English Language empowers students to find their voice, sharpen their thinking, and make a meaningful difference through the power of words.

Learning is not restricted to the classroom – through visits to different spaces and school events, learning becomes more experiential and authentic.

Both staff and students participate enthusiastically in English/Literature-related activities, showing a school-wide approach to nurturing a love for the subject.

EL Week is an annual school event in RGS planned by the English Language and Literature Department for the students.
