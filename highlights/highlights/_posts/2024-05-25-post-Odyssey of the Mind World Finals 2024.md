<p>Odyssey of the Mind is a programme where students embark on a 6-month
journey to create a thrilling, high-energy performance based around a problem
set by the competition organisers, Odyssey HQ.
<br>
<br>Throughout the process our students, guided by their teacher-mentors,
were encouraged to find new perspectives to push the limits of their creativity,
while adhering to the rules and criteria for each problem.</p>
<p>This year, 4 teams represented RGS at the World Finals! Our teams demonstrated
exceptional performance, securing remarkable results in their respective
divisions.</p>
<p>Problem 3 Division 2 (P3D2) was also awarded the special <strong>OMER's Award! </strong>The
OMER's Award recognises those individuals, coaches, team members, parents,
officials and others who, during a tournament, serve as exemplary examples
or role models through their actions or words.</p>
<p>The OMER's Award was presented to the P3D2 team for their exemplary sportsmanship
and kindness to others amidst the heat of competition. When a team from
North Carolina had a part of their set broken 30 minutes before their performance,
our girls immediately gathered the tools they had, which they had been
using, and presented the full set of tools to the other team's coach for
their use, without a moment of hesitation.</p>
<p>The girls demonstrated real selflessness and empathy for others, despite
being in the heat of competition and contending with their own sets being
incomplete. We are all very proud to see them recognised for these acts
of service to others.</p>
