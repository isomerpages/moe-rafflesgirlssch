## Financial Assistance

RGS is committed to ensuring that no deserving student is denied the opportunity to experience the Raffles Programme and pursue excellence in spite of socio-economic background. Financial assistance schemes such as the MOE Independent School Bursary (ISB), school-administered scholarships and bursaries, as well as other bursaries by self-help groups and external institutions are available to help our needy students continue with their education and motivate them to strive for greater accomplishments. &nbsp;&nbsp;

School-administered financial aid, depending on the level of subsidy, may include subsidies for enrichment programme fees and compulsory level-wide school activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;

Students who require financial aid at any point of time may approach&nbsp;[Student Services](mailto:rgs_studentservices@schools.gov.sg)&nbsp;directly or through their Form Teacher for help.
