## Learning Journeys Week 2022

From 7-11 March 2022, our students embarked on a week-long experiential journey to better understand "The Singapore Story". With participation from the whole school, including our staff who planned and facilitated the journeys, parent volunteers who accompanied and chaperoned some of our students during the activities, and our alumnae who shared their expert knowledge, various trips and activities were planned during Learning Journeys Week.  
  
These fieldtrips are excellent out-of-classroom opportunities to develop our students' civic beliefs, ties to the local community through an awareness of our nation's past, present and future, as well as their capacity for social and community action.  

**\*All activities were conducted in line with prevailing Safe Management Measures.**  

These were some of the activities our students participated in:  
  
_Walking Tour (all levels) - Students embarked on a walking tour around Braddell-Toa Payoh to visit unique and historical landmarks in the area and interact with the interesting biodiversity they encountered during the walk._

_Singapore's Water Story (Year 1) - At Bishan-AMK Park, our Year 1 students spent their morning exploring different parts of the park to learn how it contributes to Singapore's efforts to achieve self-sufficiency in her water resources. Nestled in the heartlands, the park also serves as an important community space for social bonding and is a picturesque space for many to jog or play sports at!_
