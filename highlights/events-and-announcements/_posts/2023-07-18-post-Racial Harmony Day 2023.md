**Celebrating Our Multicultural Mosaic!**

Decked in an array of ethnic costumes, RGS students and staff gathered to appreciate the beauty of our diverse races and religions as we commemorated Racial Harmony Day with the theme "Singapore: Our Multicultural Mosaic."

Our students were captivated by heart-warming skits that touched their hearts and minds. "Hope: A Lost Phone" revolved around the value of international friendship, while "Flight: A Life-Changing Journey" reminded us of the power of unity amidst diversity. These performances left a lasting impression on their young minds. 

The Ethnic Enclaves jointly organized by Parents for RGS, staff, and students provided an enriching and immersive experience. Our students delved into the significance of hawker culture, discovering its importance to our Singaporean identity. They also participated in engaging workshops, including a delightful baking session where they tried their hand at making Ondeh Ondeh, Indian Burfti, and Mini Huat Kueh. Additionally, they were treated to captivating performances by our talented Angklung Ensemble, Chinese Orchestra, and Ethnic Dance CCAs. The day was also filled with traditional games and inspiring discussions on Peranakan culture, led by our distinguished guests Dr Margaret Chan, Mrs Shirley Tan and Mr Krishnan Pillay. 

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the indefatigable Parents for RGS, enthusiastic students, and everyone else working alongside our tireless staff to make this Racial Harmony Day a memorable celebration of our multicultural mosaic. Together, let's continue to embrace and cherish the richness of diversity in Singapore!
