_“The school song is the very first song a new pupil learns when she steps into RGS. It was officially introduced in 1954, after Principal Miss Hinchliffe (principal from 1951 - 1956) commissioned Miss Goodland, the music teacher, to introduce a school song. Miss Goodland selected the song ‘From High Olympus’ from a songbook called ‘Unison’ (a collection of songs sung during the British colonial days). The people responsible for the lyrics and tune were Miss Florence Hoare and Miss H.L. Schnoor.” - From RGS History Book – Daughters of a Better Age 1844-2006_

From High Olympus flows to us the glory, <br>
On us the sacred fire descends. <br>
Rise, sisters, rise, the world is all before ye. <br>
Fear not to grasp what fortune sends.

**Chorus**. <br>
Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, <br>
Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.

A little while the sun shines high above us, <br>
And youth's elixir fills our veins, <br>
The magic fire that moves the gods to love us, <br>
The fire by which the will attains.

**Chorus.** <br>
Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, <br>
Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.

So heart to heart, we'll scale the heights of learning, <br>
No mean desires our days shall shame, <br>
Whole-hearted, true, with pride and ardour burning <br>
On, sisters, on to life and fame.

**Chorus.** <br>
Sisters in learning and sisters at heart, <br>
Life lies before us, here's luck to the start.

_(a song composed in the early 1980’s by a talented group of girls who called themselves the Jasplys: comprising WL Chan, Lisa Tan, YS Tan, Susie See, Pauline Sng, ML Lui and Shirley Yee.)_

_“But when they talked about the song "Dedication", WHAM, the melody hit me – WITH THE LYRICS - and rang clearly in my head! For one reason or other, these words stuck with me through the years, impervious to my otherwise failing memory.” – An Alumnus_

_“A song that now lingers in my head…” – An Alumnus_

We have shared our morning days, <br>
And gone through all rainy nights, <br>
Even in the darkest of nights, <br>
Stars still light up our way.

Tomorrow is a beautiful dream, <br>
A dream that will be fulfilled, <br>
Cross the bridge of rainbow, <br>
In search of the gold.

For here we stand (for here we stand) <br>
Our dearest friend (our dearest friend) <br>
Sincerely from our hearts we wish, <br>
May streams of sunlight shine <br>
like rays of hope, <br>
Hand in hand, we work and strive <br>
For the best things in life.
