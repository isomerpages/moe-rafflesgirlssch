At Raffles Girls’ School, Education and Career Guidance (ECG) counselling helps our students to explore, understand and learn about their career aspirations as part of their holistic education.

Our goal is to see our students being able to:
* Understand their own career/academic aspirations
* Develop positive attitudes towards work and learning
* Integrate their career/academic aspirations with whole-person development and life-long learning

The following range of interventions are available to our students:
* Linking study opportunities and career choices
* School-wide career guidance activities
* Learning experiences about work
* Individual student planning
