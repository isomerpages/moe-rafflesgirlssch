## Harnessing the Power of Technology for Good

While the circuit breaker period caused a trip to their plans for community service, seven groups of RGS Year 4 students, comprising 33 students in total, decided to make the switch to volunteering for a virtual reading initiative instead to continue giving back to the community. The initiative, ‘Make Hay Every Day in May’, held from 18-28 May 2020 over the course of six 30-minute sessions on video conferencing platform Zoom, was part of the Reading Remediation Programme by MOE’s UPLIFT Programme Office. It aimed to provide additional support for primary 3 and 4 students who were unable to have face-to-face reading sessions in school due to the circuit breaker.  

We speak to three of the groups who participated in the initiative to find out more about their experience.

**Project Booktique**: "Typically, at the start of each session, we would recap some vocabulary with our student to ensure knowledge retention. Thereafter, together with our main reader, En Xing, they would take turns reading each paragraph of a new book, pausing occasionally for us to explain the story or to correct our student’s pronunciation. To help her visualise the syllables of each word and concepts such as tenses, we made used of graphics. After explaining a word or concept, we would also get her to form her own sentence just to make sure she understood. Once we finished reading a book, we would ask her questions related to the story, so she could relate what happened in the story to her everyday life.

We didn’t have an established relationship with the student prior to this initiative, so there may have been some hesitation on her part to voice out what she didn’t understand in the beginning. However, over time as trust was built, she was more willing to clarify her concerns, which made the reading sessions even more meaningful and effective. We also needed to find ways to sustain her interest during the sessions. Prior to this, we didn’t know of her likes or dislikes, nor did we know about her learning style. As the sessions went by, we learnt to be flexible and to constantly adapt to her needs, which was why we made used of graphics extensively and chose adventure-themed books once we got to know that she liked those.

This experience has been very meaningful for us because it provided an opportunity for us to serve the community despite the physical restrictions imposed by circuit breaker. We were also able to explore various digital platforms to execute the sessions, which proved invaluable in expanding our horizons on the available resources out there. It was indeed satisfying to see the student being engaged by the stories, and to see her willingness to learn more.

While the pandemic has impeded the progress of some of our other planned community projects, we remain optimistic and hope that it will be possible for us to carry out some, if not the full scope of our initiatives.”
