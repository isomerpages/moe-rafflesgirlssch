## Learning Journeys Week 2022

From 7-11 March 2022, our students embarked on a week-long experiential journey to better understand "The Singapore Story". With participation from the whole school, including our staff who planned and facilitated the journeys, parent volunteers who accompanied and chaperoned some of our students during the activities, and our alumnae who shared their expert knowledge, various trips and activities were planned during Learning Journeys Week.  
  
These fieldtrips are excellent out-of-classroom opportunities to develop our students' civic beliefs, ties to the local community through an awareness of our nation's past, present and future, as well as their capacity for social and community action.  

**\*All activities were conducted in line with prevailing Safe Management Measures.**  

These were some of the activities our students participated in:  
  
_Walking Tour (all levels) - Students embarked on a walking tour around Braddell-Toa Payoh to visit unique and historical landmarks in the area and interact with the interesting biodiversity they encountered during the walk._

Nestled in the heartlands, the park also serves as an important community space for social bonding and is a picturesque space for many to jog or play sports at!_

For the Year 2s, they embarked on the Regional Immersion and Community Exploration (RICE) Programme, a signature programme for the level that takes place during LJ Week. In its original form, RICE involved an overnight immersion experience in Johor, Malaysia, where students participate in interactive and cultural activities with the locals. Since 2021, due to the COVID-19 situation, RICE activities were conducted in Singapore. Whether it is held overseas or locally, RICE is carefully and meaningfully designed for students to have rich and interactive learning experiences, and they record and reflect on their shared experiences in a journal.  
  
_National Museum (Year 2) - Students visited the National Museum to learn how to make connections between the different groups of people in Singapore's history. They also gained sociocultural intelligence, which will aid them in navigating a highly diverse world in the future._
