<p>The National School Games (NSG) is the largest inter-school competition
in Singapore, bringing together students from primary schools, secondary
schools, junior colleges, and centralised institutions across the nation.</p>
<p>Organised by schools for schools, the NSG provides a valuable platform
for students to demonstrate their athletic abilities and sportsmanship.</p>
<p>Please find below some reflections from our students:</p>

<p>1) Badminton isn‚Äôt just about singles and doubles‚Äîit‚Äôs about teamwork,
resilience, and giving it our all on the court. After the matches, both
teams came together for a combined cheer, celebrating not just the victories
but the spirit of camaraderie and sportsmanship.</p>
<p></p>
<p>"I think it‚Äôs a moment filled with pride and gratitude. As we stepped
onto the court for the finals, we really gave it our all. This has been
about more than just winning; it‚Äôs been about growth, resilience, and teamwork.
Every match taught us something new‚Äîwhether it was pushing through tough
moments, trusting each other, or staying focused under pressure. The results
were everything we could ask for.</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who came down to support us and to our coaches and
teachers for always being there for us."</p>

<p>Congratulations to our B Division girls for clinching 1st place in the
NSG South Zone Badminton Championship 2025! A huge shoutout to RI‚Äôs badminton
boys, who also emerged as champions!
<br>
<br>A heartfelt thank you to everyone who came down to support us, and to
our coaches and teachers for always being there every step of the way.
Your encouragement made all the difference!</p>
<p></p>
<p>2) I will always remember the arduous trainings we went through together
as a team, and how we spent countless nights coming up with the best lineup.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On the court, we fought for every point‚Äîeven when the odds were stacked
against us. I remember how the cheers from my teammates encouraged me to
keep my head up and stay focused during my game, ultimately helping us
turn it around and win.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To all my teachers, coaches, and seniors: thank you for your unwavering
support and guidance. We couldn‚Äôt have made it this far without you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To my B Div teammates and batchmates: thank you for believing in me when
I didn‚Äôt, and for giving me the strength to push through every competition.
I‚Äôll miss you so much, and I‚Äôm incredibly proud of how far we‚Äôve come.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I‚Äôm proud of how all of us kept fighting to the very last point‚ÄîI truly
believe we gave it our all. The matches were exhilarating, and I don‚Äôt
think any of us left the court with regrets. I couldn‚Äôt have asked for
a better team to compete with.</p>

<p>1) Congratulations to our B Division girls for clinching 1st place in
the NSG South Zone Basketball Championship 2025!
<br>
<br>‚ÄúCompeting in the South Zone has been a journey of both challenges and
growth. Facing tough teams tested our resilience and unity, but we supported
each other every step of the way. Every player gave their best, not just
in effort, but with heart and determination. Through the support of our
teammates, coaches, teachers, and supporters, we stayed focused and earned
the South Zone championship. As we move forward to Nationals, we‚Äôre ready
to train even harder, learn from this experience and face the tougher challenges
ahead with resilience and determination.‚Äù

<p>2) We Left It All on the Court.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our B Division Basketball Girls gave everything we had in the National
Finals against Nanyang Girls‚Äô High. From the first whistle to the final
buzzer, we played with heart, grit, and unity ‚Äî no regrets, no holding
back.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While we ended the season as runners-up, the result does not define our
journey. What matters most is the team we‚Äôve become ‚Äî one built on trust,
resilience, and unwavering commitment to one another.</p>
<p>We came in as underdogs. We knew the odds, but we never let that shape
our spirit. We fought for every possession, lifted each other up, and never
backed down. Every minute on court was a testament to our belief in ourselves
and each other.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was never just about a medal. It was about the heart behind every play,
the strength we found in one another, and the courage to believe that we
could.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you to our teammates, coaches, teachers, parents, friends, and supporters
‚Äî your belief in us carried us through. This journey was about more than
basketball. It was about standing together, growing stronger, and creating
memories and friendships that will last a lifetime.</p>

to work hard in preparation for the National round of the competition.
<br>
<br>"Our team has faced many challenges throughout this round, going up against

<p>Training for NSG was tough. I had leg pain that made every session a struggle,
and every mistake felt like a setback. I often felt anxious and frustrated
‚Äî but I knew my team was counting on me, and we had come too far to give
up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We were a newly formed C Division group, made up of Year 1s and Year 2s.
Most of us were completely new to the group event. Even for our two Year
2 teammates, who eventually stepped up to lead, only one of them had a
dance background. We started from scratch in February, unsure if we‚Äôd be
ready by April.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There were problems with timing, symmetry, and catching the apparatus.
We made countless adjustments, even in the week of competition. When we
saw we were 1 point down in the team score, something switched in us. We
told ourselves, ‚ÄúWe can do this.‚Äù And we pushed.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We went onto the mat not expecting much, just hoping to give our best
performance. What happened next surprised everyone‚Ä¶ including us.</p>
<p>We nailed it. Everything came together.</p>
<p></p>
<p>And we won 1st place for our group routine! ü•áüí´</p>
<p></p>
<p>We cried ‚Äî not out of sadness, but because we knew how much this meant.
All the late nights, the setbacks, the sweat and support‚Ä¶ it was all worth
it. I‚Äôm incredibly grateful we didn‚Äôt give up. This win belongs to every
single one of us.</p>

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>NSG was a challenging yet rewarding experience. Shooting constantly pushes
my mental limits, and that‚Äôs what makes it so fulfilling. The sport is
not just about precision‚Äîit is a mental game. Every shot demands complete
focus, emotional control, and the ability to stay calm under pressure.
The slightest distraction or doubt can affect performance, so it really
pushes me to develop mental resilience and discipline.</p>
<p>There were definitely tough moments along the way, but with the unwavering
support and guidance of our coaches, teachers and CCA mates, we pushed
through and grew stronger‚Äîboth individually and as a team. I'm truly grateful
for this journey and proud of how far we've come together.</p>

<p>When the odds seemed stacked against them, our RGS 'B' Div Softball girls
didn't crumble - they grew stronger. Every pitch, every swing, every cheer
from the dugout showed the heart of true champions who love the school
and love the sport. While we may have missed the podium, securing 4th place
shows the incredible grit of these student athletes. Through rain, shine,
and countless training sessions, our girls never backed down from a challenge.
You've made your coaches, friends, teachers, parents, and RGS proud!</p>

<p>Late April marked the finals of the B Division Squash National School
Games (NSG). After months of grit and grind, we are proud to share that
our girls have reclaimed the B Division NSG title from 2024, emerging as
champions!</p>
<p></p>
<p>This journey has been one of immense growth for our squashers‚Äîfrom building
resilience in chasing down every ball, to learning the importance of teamwork
and continuously motivating one another to give their best throughout the
season.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Beyond the competition, our team also demonstrated adaptability and composure

<p>1) In the heats for the C Division 100m Breaststroke earlier today, our
swimmer Chen Yue Jia (Year 1) delivered a stunning performance and broke
the NSG Swimming Meet Record ‚Äî all in her very first National School Games
representing RGS!
<br>
<br>Reflecting on the race, Yue Jia shared:
<br>
<br>‚ÄúSwimming is something I‚Äôm really passionate about. Even though it‚Äôs a
competition, the moment I hit the water, it‚Äôs all about moving forward.
I don‚Äôt focus on who‚Äôs beside me ‚Äî the cheers and noise fade away, and
my attention is fully on pushing myself. I‚Äôm really glad to have broken
the meet record, but I know I‚Äôm still capable of more. It wasn‚Äôt my personal
best, so for Thursday‚Äôs finals, I‚Äôll be giving it my all in hopes of clocking
an even better time and setting a new personal record.‚Äù
<br>
<br>We‚Äôre incredibly proud of her and wish all our swimmers the best as they
heads into the Finals this Thursday. Let‚Äôs go, RGS!</p>
<p></p>
<p>2) "I just wanted to experience it ‚Äî to be part of that moment.‚Äù</p>
<p></p>
<p>For Ng Xin Hui (Year 4), the National School Games 2025 marked a personal
turning point. A mid-distance swimmer for most of her journey, she had
always found comfort in the longer races ‚Äî ones that often took place away
from the grand finals spotlight. But this year, with her sprint times steadily
improving, she decided to challenge herself and step into something new:
the 50m Breaststroke on finals day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It wasn‚Äôt just about the race ‚Äî it was about the experience. Having spent
years cheering from the stands, Xin Hui knew how powerful the crowd‚Äôs energy
could be. In her final year representing the school, she wanted to feel
it for herself ‚Äî to race alongside her teammates and soak in the Rafflesian
spirit she had always supported from the sidelines.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Though she placed 4th, the result was far from a disappointment. ‚ÄúTo many,
it‚Äôs just 4th place. But to me, it reflects the work I‚Äôve put in and the
progress I‚Äôve made,‚Äù she shared, especially after recovering from a hip
injury and learning to adapt her technique.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The presence of Team RI ‚Äî the boys and senior girls ‚Äî at the stands with
RGS definitely showed the #RafflesiansUnite spirit. ‚ÄúWith all of us cheering
for each other, even when it‚Äôs an RGS or RI swimmer, I felt a sense of
unity and belonging to the big Rafflesian family,‚Äù she reflected.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our swimmers on a silver finish in both the 'B'
and 'C' Divisions ‚Äî but more importantly, thank you for showing us what
it means to grow, support one another, and swim with heart.</p>

it all.
<br>
<br>Even though we were down in some matches, we stayed focused and pushed
through, eventually turning the tide in our favour.
<br>
<br>With a steady and determined spirit, we trained hard and gave our all
in every match. In the end, we were able to retain the national title for
RGS‚Äîsomething we are grateful and proud to have done together as a team.
<br>
<br>This milestone would not have been possible without the constant support

training sessions to staying calm during crucial matches, we learned to
communicate better, trust each other‚Äôs strengths, and pick each other up
when the pressure was on.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Each match was a lesson in perseverance, teamwork, and belief‚Äînot just
in ourselves, but in one another. We faced every challenge together, growing
stronger and more united with every step.</p>
