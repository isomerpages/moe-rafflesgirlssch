<p>Our students took part in the Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad (SJChO)
and achieved the following results:</p>
<p>Introduced in 2010, the Singapore Junior Chemistry Olympiad (SJChO) is
a competition organised by the Singapore National Institute of Chemistry
(SNIC) in partnership with NUS, NTU, SUTD, IMRE, and ISCE^2, with support
from the Ministry of Education. This competition provides a platform for
upper secondary students to challenge themselves in their chemical knowledge
and skills.</p>
<p>Awards are given to top-performing schools based on the total number of
individual awards won. There are three bands of top-performing schools.
At the 2024 SJChO, RGS performed admirably and was placed in Band 2.</p>
