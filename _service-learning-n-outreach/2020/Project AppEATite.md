Food waste is a prevalent issue here in Singapore. However, few know or care to find out more about it. [Project AppEATite](https://www.instagram.com/project.appeatite/), an RGS Year 3 CmPS group decided to take on the topic to advocate for the reduction of food waste. Since last year, they have been collaborating with Insectta, a local urban insect farm, for several initiatives, including setting up a Black Soldier Fly (BSF) larvae bin in school (BSF larvae are voracious eaters and can eat almost anything, so they help to eat up food waste!). Some of the members were also featured in Sky High, a docuseries that was aired on Singtel’s Jia Le Channel in March this year, where they shared more about their advocacy work. They have since produced an e-book titled ‘Larry’s Big Adventure’ targeted at primary school children to help them understand how food waste can be reduced, and to encourage them to cultivate food saving habits from a young age.
