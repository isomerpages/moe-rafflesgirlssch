<h2>Historical Milestones</h2>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="RGS campus at Queen Street" src="/images/rgsmilestones.png">
</div>
<p>Established in 1879, Raffles Girls’ School (RGS) is today a leading girls’
school providing a holistic education via its six-year Raffles Programme.</p>
<p>The growth of RGS is largely attributed to the commitment of individuals
who were passionate about the education of girls in an era when the provision
of academic education for girls was considered unimportant.</p>
<p>RGS’ humble beginnings can be traced to a group of eight ladies who were
determined to rescue orphans and very poor girls from vice and provide
them with care and protection through education. Their efforts to set up
a girls’ school attached to the Singapore Institution (later renamed Raffles
Institution) were supported by Mrs Elizabeth Cavenagh (nee Moriarty), wife
of the Straits Settlements Governor, who became the School’s Patron. It
was their labour and dedication that enabled RGS to make steady progress
in student enrolment, paving the way for its status as a distinguished
educational institution in Singapore. The commitment of good people, many
of whom remain unsung heroes, continues to shape RGS as an institution
for high-ability girls.</p>
<h3>1879</h3>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist1.jpg">
</div>
<p>From its humble beginnings at Bras Basah Road on 4 March 1844 as a one-room
department in a boy’s school (Raffles Institution), RGS was officially
established in 1879 with an enrolment of 77 students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist2.jpg">
</div>
<p>Its first Headmistress was Miss M Nelson (1880 – 1884). Together with
three assistants, Miss Nelson taught the girls sewing, cooking, reading
and writing as the focus of the school then was to equip girls with the
tools to become an educated wife.</p>
<h3>1882</h3>
<p>From 1882 onwards, English speaking boys were admitted to the lower, middle
and primary classes. This was discontinued in 1927 due to the increasing
demand for places for girls.&nbsp;The school had by 1883, 4 classrooms,
occupied by 134 students</p>
<h3>1900</h3>
<p>RGS attained the status of an English High School, offering Latin as a
subject which proved useful to girls aspiring to become doctors and lawyers.</p>
<p>In 1902, the Director of Public Instruction referred to RGS as “an admirably
managed establishment”.</p>
<h3>1903</h3>
<p>RGS became a Government School – henceforth the Government set the standard
of education and appointed civil servants to run the School.</p>
<p>Principal Miss Tarbet (1904 – 1910) pushed for the start of a training
establishment where students could be trained to be teachers.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist8.jpg">
</div>
<p>To date, Miss Dorothy Martha Buckle (1910 – 1937) is the longest serving
Principal in RGS. Mr H R Cheeseman (Director of Education, Singapore) praised
her for making her mark not only as a trainer who produced teachers who
maintained “her high standards of efforts and of efficiency”, but also
as a Principal who taught students to be independent thinkers.</p>
<h3>1928</h3>
<p>As enrolment expanded, RGS moved to Queen Street in 1928 whereupon it
became a full-fledged girls’ school and stopped admitting boys to the lower
and middle forms.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist9.jpg">
</div>
<p>Principal Miss C Richardson (1938 – 1939) was known for her efforts in
impressing on students the importance of articulating the English Language
properly and her emphasis on discipline.</p>
<p>When World War Two broke out, Principal Mrs K Waddle (1939 – 1942)<strong> </strong>chose
to remain in Singapore out of dedication to her job. When she left on the
last evacuation boat just before the Japanese occupied Singapore, the boat
was torpedoed and she lost her life at sea.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist13.jpg">
</div>
<h3>1942-45</h3>
<p>RGS’ Queen Street campus was occupied by the Japanese Military Police
(“Kempeitai”) as its headquarters during the war years.</p>
<h3>1946</h3>
<p>The House system in RGS was started by Miss M M Hadley, the postwar principal
of the school (1946 - 1951), to develop in RGS students a strong sense
of belonging to the school.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist12.jpg">
</div>
<p>Ten years later when Miss Evelyn Norris became Principal, she added a
fifth house – Hadley House - in honour of Miss Hadley’s contributions to
the school. Hence, as a tribute to the former Principals, the five RGS
Houses were named after them. It is one of the oldest House systems in
Singapore.</p>
<h3>1950</h3>
<p>Principal Miss Cecily Hinchliffe (1951 – 1956) championed all-round development
of students. A Science Department was established in 1955 and a laboratory
completed in 1957. She also introduced weekly assemblies to the school
programme, which have since become part of the school’s tradition.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist14.jpg">
</div>
<p>The school motto (“Filiae Melioris Aevi” or “Daughters of a Better Age”)
was introduced in 1953, with the school's first annual Speech Day held
on the same year.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist15.jpg">
</div>
<p>The following year, in 1954, “From High Olympus” was adopted as the school
song (lyrics and music by Miss Florence Hoare and Miss H L Schnoor).</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist17.jpg">
</div>
<h3>1959</h3>
<p>In January 1959, the primary and secondary sections of the school were
separated and the secondary section moved to Anderson Road, while the primary
section was renamed Raffles Girls' Primary School (RGPS) and remained in
Queen Street till 1979 when it too moved to larger premises on Holland
Grove Road.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist19.jpg">
</div>
<p>At the school’s new premises in Anderson Road, the school operated on
“two sessions” (morning and afternoon) to cope with increasing enrolment.</p>
<p>Principal Miss M N Oehlers (1958 – 1961) oversaw the move. She had been
a student, a teacher and Assistant Principal before taking over the helm
as Principal of RGS. At her retirement ceremony in 1961, she outlined what
she regarded as important qualities to develop in students: Honesty, Courtesy
and Charity.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist16.jpg">
</div>
<h3>1961</h3>
<p>Principal Miss Noel Evelyn Norris (1961 – 1976) encouraged<strong> </strong>leadership
training and character development for girls, and avidly promoted CCAs.
She also made it compulsory for students to read both Science and Arts
subjects so as to have an all-rounded education.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist18.jpg">
</div>
<p>The school premises were upgraded such as the construction of a new Science
block and the carving out of a large new playing field.</p>
<h3>1977</h3>
<p>Principal Miss Tan Leng Neo (1977 – 1979) oversaw both the Secondary and
Pre-University classes at RGS. Believing that students absorb more through
experiential learning, she encouraged teachers to organize field trips
and outdoor activities for students.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist20.jpg">
</div>
<p>A multi-purpose parade ground was constructed to provide a suitable assembly
area for flag-raising ceremonies as well as for uniformed groups to form
up. The parade square also serves as a venue for special celebrations like
Founder’s Day, Speech Day, National Day and Teacher’s Day. This parade
ground was renamed Tan Leng Neo Square in her honour in 2001.</p>
<p>Concerned about the welfare of staff and students, Miss Tan installed
water coolers and placed terrazzo tables and chairs around the school.
She also looked into the installing of the Steven’s Road traffic lights
“right-turn green arrow” into Anderson Road to help traffic flow to the
school.</p>
<h3>1980</h3>
<p>Principal Mrs Chee Keng Soon (1980 – 1988) introduced job attachments,
talks and other activities outside of school for character and leadership
development. To inculcate in students a concern for the less fortunate,
classes were encouraged to visit welfare organisations.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist21.jpg">
</div>
<p>To ease constraints on school facilities, the Pre-University classes were
phased out in 1983. In 1984, the Gifted Education Programme was introduced.
A year later, RGS went single session when the school was given the use
of the adjoining ex-Anderson Secondary School campus.</p>
<p>Students enjoyed ample opportunities to showcase their creative talents
in music, drama, art and languages when “RGS Nite” (originally known as
“An Evening of Music and Dance”) was started. It was on this platform that
the talents of violinist Seow Lee Chin, choir pianist Karen Yip, singer
Kit Chan and actress Emma Yong were showcased.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist23.jpg">
</div>
<h3>1988</h3>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Mrs Carmee Lim RGS ex Principal" src="/images/CarmeeLim.png">
</div>
<p>Under Principal Mrs Carmee Lim (1988 – 1999), RGS moved to a holding school
located at Jalan Kuala (off River Valley Road) in 1988. A proponent of
a multi-pronged approach to education, she championed creativity, innovation
and entrepreneurship. Special rooms such as the Humanities Centre and the
RGS Guidance Centre were set up.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist24.jpg">
</div>
<p>Together with the staff, Mrs Lim came up with the concept of the Living
Values known as the four “P’s” – Principled, People-Centred, Passionate
and Professional.</p>
<p>To shape RGS into a “School for the Future”, students were exposed to
a learning environment that tapped on multimedia technology and a Cyber
Learning Centre (which came to be named in her honour) was set up. In 1989,
RGS linked up with the University of Michigan in the Interactive Simulation
project, which allowed RGS students to exchange ideas with students in
six other countries in a “Global Classroom” setting.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>1992</h3>
<p>RGS moved from its holding school in Jalan Kuala to its original location
at Anderson Road on 1 November 1992. 50 girls, carrying a torch and the
school flag, took part in the school's bus-stop relay from River Valley
Road to Anderson Road.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist27.jpg">
</div>
<h3>1993</h3>
<p>On 1 January 1993, RGS became an Independent School, recruiting her own&nbsp;teachers
and introducing innovative enrichment programmes to promote the total development
of students&nbsp;and go beyond textbooks.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist28.jpg">

<h3>1994</h3>
<p>In 1994, the RGS Chapter was formed, to replace the Women's Rafflesian
Chapter.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist29.jpg">
</div>
<h3>1999</h3>
<p>Principal Mrs Deborah Tan (1999 – 2007) played an instrumental role in
nurturing the ideals of scholarship in the students. During her tenure,
RGS achieved four Sustained Achievement Awards – the only school to do
so across the nation at the time.</p>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist30.jpg">
</div>
<p>Under her leadership, RGS and RI came together to offer a six-year Integrated
Programme (IP) called the Raffles Programme (RP). This was in response
to the recommendations for Junior College (JC) Curriculum by the Committee
on the Review of JC and Upper Secondary Education, chief among which was
to provide for a broader and more flexible curriculum.</p>
<h3>2003</h3>
<p>Registered as a society in 2003, the key objective of the Parents for
RGS Association (PRGS)’ is to connect parents, the school and students,
fostering meaningful ties among key stakeholders in the students’ holistic
development.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist32.jpg">
</div>
<h3>2004</h3>
<p>RGS and RI implemented the 6-year Integrated Programme known as the Raffles
Programme (RP) in 2004 when Mrs Deborah Tan was Principal. The RP grew
out of a strong desire to prepare students for the demands of a fast changing
world where they will be expected to lead and serve the community and nation.
The RP is consistent with the philosophy of the Raffles schools in delivering
a broad-based education that is focussed more on process than mere content.
The added emphasis on the co-curriculum is also in line with what the Raffles
schools have been well-known for.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/hist33.jpg">

</div>
<p>She saw RGS through the Raffles Institution-Raffles Junior College (RI-RJC)
merger, maintaining RGS’ distinctive identity and heritage as a premier
school for girls and close partnership with the “merged” RI.</p>
<p>Under her watch, the F1 Centre for Innovation - the RGS F1 Centre for
Innovation – was set up to promote learning and engagement in Science,
Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).</p>
<h3>2009</h3>
<p>The Wallace Environmental Learning Laboratory (WELL) was established by
RGS and NParks with sponsorship from GlaxoSmithKline and the support of

<h3>2014</h3>
<p>Establishment of the RGS Alumnae - in July 2014, the RGS Alumnae was established
as an association for RGS graduates. Its aim is to inspire, enable and
engage the alumnae to build a community that embodies the Rafflesian spirit
and work towards the betterment of society, nation and self.</p>
<p>To celebrate RGS’ 135th birthday and raise funds for the New Campus, Homecoming

<p>Arising from a school-wide review of RGS’ programmes and resources, Raffles
Academy (RA) 2.0, a Talent Development programme, was implemented. Students
are able to broaden and/or deepen their learning in a particular area of
study through Coursework or Research Modules. This inclusive, opt-in programme
combines the best features of three RGS’ instructional programmes to develop
in Year 3 and 4 students the fundamental skills and passion for research
and creative problem solving (Research Studies), to cater to the many varied
interests of these students beyond the academic curriculum (Year 4 Options)
and to stretch and challenge students with advanced knowledge and skills
in their talent area (Raffles Academy). These modules are taught by RGS
teachers as well as industry practitioners and experts in tertiary institutions.</p>
<h3>2019</h3>
<p>RGS commemorated Singapore’s Bicentennial with a skit on the Founding
of Singapore in January; a hall assembly in April reflecting on RGS’ journey

</div>
<h3>2020</h3>
<p>RGS began its academic year in the new campus at Braddell under a new
Principal, Ms Haslinda Zamani.</p>
<p>To ensure learning outcomes meet the needs of our students and society
in the near and further future, RGS embarked on an envisioning process
at the start of the year, involving all members of staff, and included
input from alumnae, students and parents.</p>
<p>Arising from the Gifted Education Branch curriculum study report of the
Raffles Programme, school efforts gave focus to enhancing enactment of
classroom teaching including design of extension learning activities for
very high ability learners.</p>
<p>Efforts also went into making the new campus safe and vibrant like a home
away from home for students and staff members.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/cu21.jpg">
</div>
<p>The Covid-19 pandemic helped the school to have a deeper sense of resolve,
about the kind of future that we want to build together for RGS. The experience
of remote learning, for eg, using online platforms to communicate, to connect,
to encourage hearts and minds, have given the school confidence to forge
ahead in exploring new ways of learning and working through harnessing
the power of technology.</p>
<h3>2021</h3>
<p>RGS implemented its new five-year Strategy Map with initiatives that support
the school’s vision of future learning at RGS.</p>
<p>In February, RGS became the first school in Singapore to roll out the
use of iPads for Year One students as part of the National Digital Literacy
Programme.</p>
<p>At the start of Term 2, the school embarked on regular fortnightly Home
Based Learning for all levels. A research study headed by the RGS PeRL
team was launched to help the school better understand how teachers use
blended learning to enhance learning opportunities.</p>
<p>In support of RGS’s Digital Curriculum, the Keppel Sandbox was launched
at RGS. The Sandbox is a digital makerspace for RGS students to ideate,
incubate their ideas, create prototypes and gather feedback as they work
on their technological solutions, so that eventually our girls will be
able to contribute to and lead in the digital work as confident and empowered
young women.</p>
<p>RGS welcomed Justice Mavis Chionh as Chairperson of the School’s Board
of Governors, succeeding Justice Judith Prakash who had served for 25 years
with dedication and tenacity, leading the school through many milestones.</p>
<h3>2022</h3>
<p>To promote the capacity for life-long and self-directed learning, which
is a central objective of the Personalised Digital Learning Programme,
RGS adopted a framework aligning Executive Functioning Skills (EFS) to
each phase of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL). Fourteen Executive Functioning
Skills were identified and each was categorised in terms of a phase in
SRL - Planning, Performance and Self-Reflection.</p>
<p>The school and RI conducted a Raffles Programme Curriculum Review to enhance
alignment and continuity of outcomes and standards for Years 1 to 6 in
both schools.</p>
<p>RGS continues to give back to the community for eg by participating in
the MOE-NLB KidsREAD programme, where upper secondary students read to,
and facilitate activities to First Toa Payoh Primary School and New Town
Primary School students, so that they can develop an interest in reading.
The school also deepened its service to Greenwood Primary school, as two
student-teams continued e-reading and math tutoring programmes started
in 2020 and 2021, with a third team starting a science tutoring programme
this year. Two other teams also deepened their service with Admiralty Primary
School and Canberra Primary School, tutoring the students in Math.</p>

<p>RGS bid farewell to Principal Haslinda Zamani (Dec 2019 to Dec 2023).
Under her watch, students were empowered to promote green efforts and co-create
the lived physical environment as they make RGS home e.g. Cogitare set
up a butterfly garden, and a rooftop Edible Garden sponsored by the Tanoto
Foundation was created as an educational hub for sustainable planting and
growth, aiming to nurture 'citizen farmers' among RGS staff and students.</p>
<p>Regular reviews were also conducted to ensure timely updates to school
rules to enhance student agency, safety and well-being.</p>
<p>Social mixing opportunities and working with community organisations were
provided to enable RGS students to engage with their peers and others from
diverse background. Over 65 per cent of RGS students have initiated community
projects, highlighting their dedication to service.</p>

<p>In 2024, RGS welcomed Mrs. Ong Hong Peng as Principal and Ms. Valerie
Yeo as Deputy Principal, while bidding a fond farewell to Deputy Principals
Ms. Chin Jen Fu and Mrs. Mary George Cheriyan, whose contributions were
deeply valued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;A significant shift was introduced for Year 1 students, who now
experience a dedicated Foundation Year. This initiative is designed to
facilitate their transition from Primary School into the Raffles Programme.
To nurture a stronger focus on learning, Year 1 students will not receive
Grades or a Grade Point Average (GPA). Instead, the End-of-Year Progress
Report will feature Percentage scores complemented by qualitative feedback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Aligned with the values-driven ethos of the Raffles Programme, subject
teachers will also provide qualitative evaluations, highlighting each student’s
commitment to learning, as well as their personal and interpersonal effectiveness.
This holistic approach underscores the school’s dedication to character
development alongside academic growth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To chart the future of RGS, the school launched its Strategic Planning
process with a staff engagement session in November, fostering a collaborative
vision for the years ahead.</p>
