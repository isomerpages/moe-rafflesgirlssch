## NPCC Day 2022

Our cadets from RGSâ€™s National Police Cadet Corps (RGNP) celebrated NPCC Day with a parade during morning assembly on 18 May 2022. The unit is extremely proud that the cadets, in their full uniform (Year 2s, 3s and 4s) and PT (Physical Training) kit (Year 1s) were able to show how well they embodied the values of NPCC: discipline, loyalty, integrity, resourcefulness, tenacity and civic-consciousness.  
  
The unit also celebrated their achievement of the Unit Overall Proficiency Award gold in 2021. Congratulations, RGNP!
