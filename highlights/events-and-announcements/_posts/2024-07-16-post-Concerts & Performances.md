<p>The live concerts and performances hosted by our girls from various Visual
&amp; Performing Arts <a href="https://www.rgs.edu.sg/holistic-education/cca/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">CCAs</a> at RGS provide
a wonderful opportunity for students to showcase their artistic talents.
These events, which welcome parents and friends as audiences, highlight
the students' hard work and dedication while serving as a platform for
artistic expression and personal growth.</p>

<p>By collaborating with partner schools both locally and overseas, students
gain invaluable experience and exposure to diverse artistic styles and
cultures. School performances are vital as they foster a sense of community,
encourage creativity, and enhance students' confidence. They play a crucial
role in the holistic development of students, nurturing their passion for
the arts and providing them with memorable experiences that contribute
to their overall growth and development.</p>
