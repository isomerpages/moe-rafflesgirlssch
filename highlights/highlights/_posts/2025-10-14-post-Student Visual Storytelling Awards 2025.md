<p>The <em>Student Visual Storytelling Awards</em> is a competition spearheaded
by Objectifs, celebrating the creativity and vision of today’s youth. Through
photography and film, students share insights into their lives, interests,
and perspectives, offering a compelling window into their world. This year’s
theme, “Treasure,” invited students to reflect on what they hold dear and
value most.</p>
<p>Congratulations to Sun Xi Eva (S404) for being recognised as the Student
Photographer of the Year.</p>
