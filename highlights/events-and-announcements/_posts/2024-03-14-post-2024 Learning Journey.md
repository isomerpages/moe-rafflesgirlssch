<p>As Term 1 concluded, our girls enthusiastically engaged in the 'Learning
Journeys (LJ)' and 'Regional Immersion and Community Exploration (RICE)'
week. They immersed themselves in the exhilarating realm of civic engagement,
forging strong ties with the community and gearing up for impactful social
action. At RGS, LJ and RICE play integral roles in our Character and Citizenship
Education (CCE) programme, offering immersive learning experiences beyond
the classroom.&nbsp;</p>
