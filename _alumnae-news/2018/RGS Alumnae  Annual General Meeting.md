On behalf of RGS, I wish to place on record my deepest thanks to all the Exco Members, past and present, including Ms Shanaz Rauff (Class of 1997), who has retired from the current Exco, for your commitment and dedication in serving your alma mater. We also welcome back Exco members, Ms Chua Yi Wen and Ms Ting Hui Shan, who had served on the 1st Exco. 

We wish to thank the Exco, too, for raising more than $100,000 for the school, from the movie screening of “Guardians of the Galaxy II” to the sale of the Filiae Bear and other memorabilia, and the ORA Fundraising Golf of which $66,000 was raised for the RGS New Campus Development Fund.

Many activities were organised to connect generations of RGS girls, inspiring them to give back to the school in different ways. One was the “RGS Girls Around The World” Lego dolls project to connect RGS alumnae and strengthen bonds in the RGS community both locally and globally. In 2017, these “girls” returned home to the school after a year of travelling to 100 cities in 30 countries. Named after principals, teachers, and friends, these “girls” were welcomed back enthusiastically at the 2017 Founder’s Day celebrations cum Groundbreaking ceremony, and they will be housed in a display case which features the school badge and school gate – as a symbol of the delightful diversity of the RGS alumnae family spread all over the world.

“Chic Chats” continue to be popular events for members to meet and network in a casual setting, at food establishments owned by alumnae. A RGSA “Chic Chefs” series was started in 2017 – whereby budding Rafflesian chefs and food enthusiasts were treated to a nostalgic experience of baking in the school’s Home Economics kitchen.

We congratulate Ms Patricia Liu and Ms Lee Twe Jeog on being returned as President and Vice-president respectively.

I am confident that the RGS Alumnae, under the leadership of Patricia and Jeog, will grow from strength to strength, and continue to provide opportunities for RGS girls to serve the alma mater, nation and society.
