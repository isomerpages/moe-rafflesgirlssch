<p>Our students have taken the lead in spearheading ground-up initiatives
to foster a culture of care and empathy.At the forefront is Project Praesidio,
a Community Problem Solving team, of eight Year Four students, who tackle
the critical issue of youth mental health. By addressing the social stigma
and knowledge gaps that often hinder help-seeking, their impactful work
includes leveraging social media, hosting events, and developing a self-care
app prototype called “Efflo”. They also organised a Mental Health Webinar
to further engage the community.
<br>
<br>Wanting to reach younger audiences, the team created "Pat &amp; Friends”,
an illustrated mental health guide for primary school students. Now available
in ten National Library Board <a href="https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/search/card?id=a30dfa4e-22b4-56b4-9531-8c749da70d66&amp;entityType=FormatGroup" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">libraries</a> and
various school libraries, this guide brings the message of hope and understanding
to young minds across the nation. </p>

<p>
<br>In addition to these student-led initiatives, RGS has strengthened her
commitment to mental health since 2020 by equipping students with self-care
tools and peer support strategies, such as the LEAPERS model. This effort
led to the creation of the CAREShare series, an annual programme that empowers
students to become peer supporters and student leaders to become peer coaches.
Recognising the crucial role teachers play in fostering well-being, the
CAREShare Series ensures that every teacher actively contributes to the
holistic well-being of their students.</p>

<p>Counsellors from our Filiae Centre (FC) play a key role in training student
leaders and peer helpers as coaches, creating a nurturing school environment
where students can access both peer and adult guidance, ensuring well-being
across emotional, intellectual, physical, and inner wellness dimensions.
Our Year 4 students also benefit from transition talks led by RI counsellors
and peer helpers, ensuring a smooth journey as they move forward.
<br>
<br>Throughout October, Mental Health Awareness Month, our FC counsellors
guide the student peer helpers in curating interactive mental health exhibitions
at the Deborah Tan Expressions Space. These engaging displays provide students
with meaningful insights into mental wellness, further reinforcing the
importance of early intervention and continuous support. All these initiatives
highlight our unwavering dedication to mental health and overall well-being
of students, ensuring they thrive in a supportive and nurturing environment.</p>
