## RGS-RGSA Project Well-Being in Support of CDE

RGS students penned messages of appreciation on specially-designed cards that were distributed to participants of the Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) on Sunday, 18 April 2021. The event was extra special because it was held at the Anderson campus where RGS was located before moving to our present site at Braddell Rise.  
  
Gracing the event was Minister of State, Ministry of Education and Ministry of Manpower, Ms Gan Siow Huang, who herself is an RGS alumna. The RGS Alumnae (RGSA) Association also conducted a well-being talk followed by a wellness yoga session, as well as provided yoga mats for the session.  
  
It is heartening to see RGS girls, past and present, pitching in to build a more caring and inclusive society by spreading positivity through words and action.
