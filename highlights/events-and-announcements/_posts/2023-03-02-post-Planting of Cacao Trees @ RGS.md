As part of our Environment Sustainability efforts @ RGS, 5 cacao trees were planted recently along the strip of land between our school field and neighbouring Braddell Heights.  
  
The seedlings and planting of the trees were sponsored by Ms Janice Wong, who is on her quest to plant 1,000 cacao trees across Singapore. Ms Wong will be sponsoring a total of 20 cacao trees that will be planted around our RGS Campus. Our RGS Alumnae (RGSA) is supporting the effort as well.  
  
RGS hopes to educate our girls on sustainable planting and growth, nurture citizen farmers among our staff & students. We also hope to encourage them to be active creators in environmental stewardship through contributing to the Million Trees and Bean to Bar Movement, among other initiatives.  
  
We look forward to more RGS Green Initiatives in the near future.
