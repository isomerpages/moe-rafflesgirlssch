_In celebration of Teachers' Day 2020, RGS House interviewed some of our teachers to feature in this video. Inspired by the popular YouTube series '73 Questions with Vogue', RGS House hoped that the video will allow students to get to know their teachers better - their likes, dislikes and motivations._
