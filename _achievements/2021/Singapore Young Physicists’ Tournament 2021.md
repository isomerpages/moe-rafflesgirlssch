## Singapore Young Physicists’ Tournament 2021

Two teams of RGS students represented the school at the Singapore Young Physicists' Tournament (SYPT) 2021 under both Category A and Category B. After months of preparation, with both teams clearing the Shortlisting in January earlier this year, the teams entered the virtual tournament held on 6 March (Category B) and 13 March (Category A) respectively.

After four rounds of challenges, the Category B team comprising _(from right in above photo)_ team leader Isabelle Ong Li Xin, members Noh Sangeun and Ye Qianshu (all from Year 4) clinched a Silver (5th) Award, while the Category A team comprising _(from right in below photo)_ team leader Sun Xiaoqing, members Koay Tze Erhn and Xie Yunyin (all from the class of 2020) set a new record with a Silver (3rd) Award after pitting their skills against other teams, with some from Junior Colleges! The achievement by the Category A team is the best showing by RGS since taking part in Category A of the tournament.

Congratulations to the teams and also to our teachers from the RGS Science department Ms Angel Lim, Mr Tan Hup Yew, Mr Yang Kian Hong and Ms Cheong Szu Chuang who mentored the girls.  
  
SYPT seeks to bring students through a process of what physicists do, from research to modelling, experimentation and finally to an oral defence before peers and experts. It provides authentic learning experiences in the learning of physics. Participants of the SYPT stand to represent Singapore in the International Young Physicists' Tournament. Traditionally held as a face-to-face competition, changes to the format of the tournament was made to adhere to Safe Management Measures, where teams have to go through a full-day of challenges held via Zoom meetings.
