## Events

PRGS’s events provide a great opportunity for parents/guardians to network and have a better understanding of the school and their child’s/ward’s student life. Talks and workshops organised by PRGS for parents/guardians provide insights into certain topics which may be relevant to parents/guardians, while the signature “Breakfast Dialogues with Principals” allows parents/guardians to have discussions with the school leadership in a small-group setting.
