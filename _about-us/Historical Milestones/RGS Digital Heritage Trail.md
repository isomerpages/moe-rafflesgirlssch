Welcome! Take a walk through our RGS Digital Heritage Trail to discover the history of the school, and in part that of the community and nation, as you visit the different parts of our campus. We also welcome you to share your memories or suggestions with us atÂ [RGS.Memories@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg](mailto:RGS.Memories@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg)  
  
_This project is brought to you by the RGS Prefectorial Board and the Throwback Project 2021, and supported by the National Heritage Board._
