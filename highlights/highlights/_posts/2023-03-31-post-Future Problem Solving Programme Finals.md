We are delighted to host the Future Problem Solving Programme 2023 National Finals (Hybrid) at our Braddell Campus.

The Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP) is an excellent vehicle to teach problem solving strategies across the curriculum while promoting the development of 21st Century Competencies within the students. This year, students showcased their action plans under the theme of ‘Mining’.

This year's event also saw the inclusion of a Community Problem Solving (CmPS) Programme exhibition where students showcased meaningful approaches to solve real life problems within the community of their choice.

Platforms such as these also allow students to engage with their peers from 12 primary schools and 10 secondary schools & JCs across Singapore.

RGS has been the national convenor of the FPSP since 2009 and we look forward to hosting many more initiatives over the coming years.
