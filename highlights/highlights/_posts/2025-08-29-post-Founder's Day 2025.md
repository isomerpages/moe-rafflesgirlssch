<p>Our 146th Founder’s Day was a celebration of heritage, community, and
the spirit that unites us, captured in this year’s theme&nbsp;<em>Different Stories, One Heartbeat.</em>

<p>We were honoured to welcome Ms&nbsp;Belinda Tanoto&nbsp;(Class of 2001),
Member of the Board of Trustees of the Tanoto Foundation, as our Guest
of Honour. The occasion also gave us the opportunity to celebrate the achievements
of our students across academics, leadership, service, sports, and the
arts, culminating in the presentation of the prestigious&nbsp;Rafflesian
Award to Chen Kaixuan Michelle (Class of 2024)</p>

<p>We also recognised the dedication of our staff through awards for teaching,
mentorship, and long service, while music, dance, and student-led performances
filled the day with colour and joy.</p>

<p>And of course, what’s a birthday without a cake! The RGS Alumnae (RGSA)
gifted a beautiful cake, while the Parents for RGS Association (PRGS) delighted
everyone with ice cream stations at the reception. We are also grateful
to our educational partners for their thoughtful flowers and warm wishes.</p>

<p>Our heartfelt thanks go to our Board of Governors, PRGS, RGSA, programme
partners, alumnae, parents, staff, and students for coming together to
make this milestone truly meaningful.</p>
<p>As we look ahead with hope and determination, we remain committed to nurturing&nbsp;<em>Daughters of a Better Age</em>&nbsp;yesterday,
today and always.</p>
