"All it takes to set a wave in motion  <br>
Is a single word, an action"

Sounds familiar? If so, you have been singing along to this year's National Day Song "The Road Ahead"! This song was one of the various items streamed live over Zoom during the RGS National Day Celebrations. We are honoured to have two esteemed guests, Ms Adele Tan (Class of 1990), Group Director of Strategic Planning, Urban Redevelopment Authority and Ms Attiya Bte Ashraf Ali (Class of 2011), Vice President, Mendaki Club, to deliver their pre-recorded speeches, which left food for thought for many of us.

The highlight of the concert segment was the "LoveSG"and Fashion Parade items. The "LoveSG" item requires the Y4 classes to plan and execute creative and humorous skits that highlighted their iteration of the Singapore Spirit. Similarly, the meticulously designed Singapore themed outfits by the Y4 classes during the Fashion Parade had everyone in awe too! The celebrations culminated in a Prize Presentation and a formal Recognition of Staff Recipients of the National Day Commendation and Long Service Awards.

Overall, the celebrations ended with a flourish and we could not have done it without everyone chipping in together, our RGS and Singapore spirit!
