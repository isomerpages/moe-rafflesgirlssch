## Co-Curricular Activities

The vision, mission and goals of the RGS Co-Curricular Activities (CCA) programme are:

**Vision** Daughters of exemplary character who embody community spirit<br>
**Mission** To be active creators of a better community for all<br>
**Goals** To develop model character and leadership, foster team and school spirit, and nurture talents and potential

CCAs ensure that our students have a balanced range of experiential learning experiences. Through CCAs, they get to participate in various competitions, overseas trips, workshops and performances. CCAs in RGS build resilience and nurture in our students a deep passion for specific interest areas as well as leadership and teamwork. As CCAs are more experiential by nature, the learning in CCA frequently provides a balanced range of experiential learning opportunities that help develop a strong and healthy body through participation in games, uniformed groups, competitions, overseas trips and workshops.

CCA participation is compulsory for all of our students. While we strive to meet their diverse needs, there is a quota in the number of members a CCA can offer to ensure that the quality of learning and safety of our students are not compromised.

We have a total of 36 CCAs in RGS under four categories: Physical Sports, Visual & Performing Arts, Uniformed Groups and Clubs & Societies. They are:
