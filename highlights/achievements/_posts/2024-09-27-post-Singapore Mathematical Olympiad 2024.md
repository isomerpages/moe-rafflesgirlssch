<p>The SMO is an annual competition organised by the Singapore Mathematical
Society (SMS), which has been conducting national mathematical competitions
since the 1950s. Over the years, these competitions have undergone several
name changes, with the current name, SMO, adopted in 2001. The competition
aims to test the ingenuity and mathematical problem-solving abilities of
participants, while identifying and nurturing mathematical talent in secondary
schools, high schools, and junior colleges across Singapore.</p>
<p>Since 2014, the SMO school ranking system has followed a criteria-based
format. Schools earn points based on the number of participants who registered
and attempted the paper, as well as the number of Gold, Silver, Bronze
awards, and Honourable Mentions achieved by students. Schools are then
awarded an SMO School Award based on the total points accumulated.</p>
