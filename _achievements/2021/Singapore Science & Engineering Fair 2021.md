## Singapore Science & Engineering Fair 2021

The Singapore Science & Engineering Fair (SSEF) is a national competition organised by the Ministry of Education, A\*STAR and Science Centre Singapore, and is affiliated to the prestigious Regeneron International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), which is regarded as the Olympics of science research competitions.  
  
Just as in 2020, SSEF 2021 took place virtually in lieu of safe distancing measures. A total of 470 projects were entered for the competition, of which 320 were shortlisted for the final judging on 31 March. RGS registered 24 projects for the competition, of which 19 were shortlisted for the final judging. Under the guidance of RGS teacher-mentors, the RGS projects achieved 2 Gold Awards, 3 Silver Awards, 2 Bronze Awards and 3 Merit Awards. 4 teams also received special awards for their projects:

The school-based project ‚ÄòSupplementation of Lactobacillus casei reduces¬†ùõÉ-amyloid accumulation in Alzheimer Drosophila melanogaster‚Äô has been selected to be one of six projects to represent Singapore at the Regeneron ISEF scheduled for the first week of May! SSEF judges were impressed with the passion of the team members and the extent of ownership they demonstrated during the final judging.

Another project ‚ÄôStool Recognition for Colorectal Cancer Detection through Deep Learning‚Äô has also been selected to represent Singapore at the Global Youth Science and Technology Bowl (GYSTB) in June. The GYSTB is an international student science project competition in Biology, Chemistry, Physics and Engineering in Hong Kong, organised by the Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups. It showcases global youth scientific achievement and innovation, aiming to promote science and technology, and providing a platform for global youths to develop their creativity and scientific mindsets, facilitate the exchange of scientific ideas, interests and abilities among young scientists all over the world.  
  
In the Junior Scientist category, a total of 32 projects were shortlisted, and under the guidance of our RGS teacher-mentors, all three of the RGS registered projects were shortlisted for the final judging, and the following are the teams‚Äô achievements:
