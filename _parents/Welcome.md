## Welcome

Parents for Raffles Girls' School (Secondary) Association (PRGS) was established in 2023. We work closely with the school to provide a support network for parents/guardians of RGS students, and organise activities to allow our members to develop and maintain links with the school. We also collaborate with the school in running programmes to facilitate our members' and their daughters'/wards' journeys through RGS.

If you would like to play an active and involved role in PRGS's events and activities, do emailÂ [prgs@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg](mailto:prgs@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg).
