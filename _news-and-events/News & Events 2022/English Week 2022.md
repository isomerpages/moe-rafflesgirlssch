EL Week is an annual school event in RGS planned by the English Language and Literature Department for the students. Activities during the week are planned to promote a love for English Language, and to celebrate creativity, innovation and excellence in the use of the medium through enriched experiences.  
  
Held from 7-11 February, the theme and tagline for EL Week this year is 'Games'/'Pause and Press Play', and some of the activities students participated in for the week include a micro fiction writing competition, a workshop on creating interactive stories, a movie screening and dress-up day!
