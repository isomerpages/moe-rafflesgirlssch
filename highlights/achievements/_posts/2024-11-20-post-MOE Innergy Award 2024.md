<li>
<p>Bronze Award for “Every Learner a Pilot”:
<br>To address challenges faced by lower secondary students, RGS introduced
the Personalised Digital Learning Student Handbook and Executive Function
Skills Student Workbook. These resources integrate the principles of Self-Regulated
Learning (Zimmerman) and Executive Function Skills (Harvard Center on the
Developing Child), empowering students to adopt effective habits and become
self-regulated learners in the digital age.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Commendation Award for “Unlocking the Full Potential of Blended Learning
as a Pedagogy: An Evidence-informed Solution”:
<br>Recognising the potential of Blended Learning (BL) to enhance student
engagement and agency, this project employed an evidence-informed approach
that combines school-based research with practitioner expertise. The initiative
reframed BL as a pedagogical approach, equipping educators to harness the
dual modalities of BL effectively and empowering students in their learning
journey.</p>
