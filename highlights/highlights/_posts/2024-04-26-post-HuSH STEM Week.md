<p><strong>Itâ€™s HuSH-STEM Week at RGS!</strong>
</p>
<p>Jointly organised by the Humanities and Science departments, this year's
theme "Step Out, Start Up" ignited a spark in our hearts, inspiring us
to step out, create, connect, and contribute towards a brighter tomorrow.</p>
<p>From captivating Start-Up Showcase hall assemblies to interactive workshops
and informative learning journeys, we had the opportunity to engage in
deep discussions with young trailblazers from diverse start-ups and enterprises,
sparking our creativity and fuelling our aspirations.</p>
<p>As we reflect on this week's experiences, let's reaffirm our commitment
to fostering a culture of innovation and social responsibility. Together,
we can inspire each other to become advocates for positive change in our
society.</p>
