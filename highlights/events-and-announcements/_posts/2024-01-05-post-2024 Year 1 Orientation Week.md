<p><strong>Welcome Year 1s!</strong></p><p>Marking the start of their Rafflesian journey, our Year 1s participated in a fun-filled Orientation Week programme from 2-5 January specially planned by their seniors from the Leadership Boards. The week-long programme culminated in the Year 1 Orientation Concert, with each class presenting an original performance based on the orientation theme ‘One Heart, One Voice’, and the RGS Initiation Ceremony, where the Year 1s are presented to their parents for the first time as full-fledged RGS students.</p><p>Here are some pictures from the week-long orientation programme:</p><p></p>
