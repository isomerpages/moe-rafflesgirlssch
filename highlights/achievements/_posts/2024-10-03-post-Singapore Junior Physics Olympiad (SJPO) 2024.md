<p>The SJPO, organised by the Institute of Physics, Singapore (IPS) with
the support of the Ministry of Education (MOE), saw a total of 2,044 secondary
school students participating this year. This prestigious competition encourages
students to delve deeper into the study of physics beyond the standard
curriculum. It challenges participants to apply critical and inventive
thinking to solve novel physics problems, fostering a greater appreciation
for the subject.</p>
