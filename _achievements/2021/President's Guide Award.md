## President's Guide Award

We are proud to announce that three of our Year 4 RGS Girl Guides Long Shi-Min, Isabel, Nandhini Elangovan and Alisha Insyirah Binte Jasni are recipients of the President's Guide Award (PGA) 2021. They are among five Guides who were awarded this year in recognition of their love for Guiding, commitment towards the Guiding Movement, and efforts in upholding Guiding values and skills to respectable standards.  
  
The PGA is the highest level of achievement for a Guide and is given out by the President of Singapore.
