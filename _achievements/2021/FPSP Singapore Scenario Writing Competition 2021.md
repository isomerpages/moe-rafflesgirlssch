As one of the top three winners of the FPSP Singapore Scenario Writing Competition (Senior Division), Ashlyn's scenario was submitted for the 2022 FPSP International Scenario Writing Competition in March 2022. Over 50 Senior Division scenario writers from different countries such as the US, Australia and New Zealand participated and Ashlyn did well, emerging 6th Place in the Senior Division. Congratulations, once again, to Ashlyn!  
  
At the On-Site Scenario Writing Team Competition, invited scenario writers are asked to write a spontaneous scenario based on the National Final future scene. Students are randomly assigned to teams of three or four students. The team members collectively decide on a general theme and setting for a futuristic scenario. Then each team member writes a scenario from a different perspective based on those parameters. The following students also did the school proud with their achivements:

| Division  | Name of Student  | Achievement  |
|:-:|---|---|
| Middle  |Ethel Kam Tien   |  Best Writer/Best Team |
|   | Glenda Lim Yu Xuan  | Best Team  |
| Senior  | Zhou Leyan Lilia  | Best Writer/Best Team  |
|   |   |   |

Scenario Writing is a creative writing activity for individual students, which offers them the opportunity to create a short story of 1,500 words, set at least 20 years in the future, arising from any one of the FPS topics set for the year.
