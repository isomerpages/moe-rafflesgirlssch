The National School Games (NSG) is an annual competition held in Singapore that brings together schools from various levels, including primary, secondary, junior college, and centralized institution. It is the largest inter-school competition in the country, organized by schools themselves for the benefit of their students.

With over 55,000 student athletes participating, the NSG offers more than 400 championship titles across a wide range of sports. The NSG places emphasis not only on sporting excellence but also on character development. Its motto, "Character in Sporting Excellence," acknowledges the significant role that sports participation and competitions play in shaping the character of students. This highlights the belief that while pursuing excellence in sports, students also develop important qualities and values.
