## Mother Tongue Fortnight 2022

In support of MOE's efforts to promote student learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue Languages and cultures, our RGS Languages Department organised our very own Mother Tongue Fortnight for the whole of Term 1 Week 3 and 4.  
  
The theme for the event this year "I Want to Know More about My Culture" aims to foster in our students the passion for cultural learning, and encourage our students to recognise their ability to appreciate and experience MTL as 'a living language' in everyday life.  
  
The activities organised provided an authentic and experiential opportunity for students to use their MTL, deepen their sense of belonging and rootedness, and understand their social role in the context of their respective cultures.  
  
Some of the activities students participated in include Malay Traditional Games and Sahibba Competition, workshops on Jawi (traditional Malay writing), Oyilattam Tamil Folk Dance, Tamil poetry writing, traditional Chinese medicine conducted by our very own teacher from the Science department, a picture book drawing class and a lantern-making session.
