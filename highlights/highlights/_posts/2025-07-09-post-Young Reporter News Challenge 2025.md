<p>Growing up with a brother with autism, Chen Yiyin (S313) was deeply moved
by the quiet strength of caregivers and the power of unconditional love.
This personal journey became the heart of her Chinese news feature titled <em>《看护者也是天使，释放最特殊的爱》</em> (“Caregivers
Are Angels Too – Releasing the Purest Form of Love”), which shines a spotlight
on the work of Youngstar SG, a non-profit that helps youths with autism
regain routine through meaningful work.</p>
<p>Her video report was praised for its authenticity, empathy, and social
relevance, earning her the Bronze Award in the “Fresh News” category of
the 8world Young Reporter News Challenge 2025（《我来报新闻2025》挑战赛）. Yiyin also
received a Special Commendation as Best Young Reporter for her fluent delivery
and heartfelt storytelling.</p>
<p>Her story was later featured in an 8world News article titled 《陪伴自闭症哥哥成长
她记录爱也学会了爱》 (“Growing Up with an Autistic Brother – She Documented Love
and Learned to Love”), which explores how her bond with her brother inspired
her to give voice to others with similar experiences.</p>
