<p>The Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation celebrates the performing
arts, featuring a diverse range of disciplines and genres that reflect
Singapore’s vibrant multicultural heritage.</p>
<p>These experiences go beyond competition or performance—they foster empathy,
camaraderie, and a strong sense of pride and purpose in every participant.</p>
<p>Please find below some reflections from our students:</p>

<p>Congratulations to our Angklung Ensemble for being the first to shine
at the SYF Arts Presentation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This year, they took the stage in their new costumes, inspired by various
ethnic costumes to reflect the rich diversity of our cultural heritage.
The vibrant orange shawls and intricately patterned batik skirts pay homage
to traditional elements while adding a fresh and elegant touch to their
performance.</p>

<p>We poured our hearts, time, and energy into every rehearsal, every note,
and every detail. While the result may not have been what we had hoped
for, it does not take away from everything we have gained and grown through
together.
<br>
<br>We’ve learnt that success isn’t always about recognition, but about the
process — the moments we lifted each other up, the laughter and late nights,
and how we became a family through it all. We discovered resilience, commitment,
and the courage to keep going even when things didn’t go our way.
<br>
<br>As our conductor once said, “The goal is that every one of us improves
from where we started to where we are now.”
<br>
<br>From the bottom of our hearts, we are proud to say: we have achieved that
goal — and that, above all, is what truly matters.
<br>
<br>Just as important, we learnt what it means to love what we do — to show
up not just for the award, but for each other.
<br>
<br>SYF may be over, but the bond we’ve built and the lessons we carry with
us will last far longer than any certificate.
<br>
<br>To our RGS Band Symphonic — let’s keep playing with heart, and always
hold your heads high.</p>

<p></p>
<p>We presented a dance piece titled “You, Yours”, featuring two contrasting
songs. The first conveyed the despair and emotional weight that follows
failure — a feeling of being trapped in darkness. As the piece progressed,
the choreography evolved, becoming more fluid and assertive, reflecting
the emergence of hope and confidence upon finding light in the darkness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Ultimately, our piece sought to portray the journey of self-forgiveness,
delivering an empowering message: no matter how many times we stumble,
the most important thing is to focus on the light and draw strength from
it to rise again.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the lead-up to SYF, we gained invaluable learning experiences and had
the opportunity to collaborate with other schools. These exchanges provided
fresh perspectives, encouraged mutual learning, and reminded us to persevere
even in the face of uncertainty. They also deepened our understanding of
the intention behind the piece and strengthened our commitment to expressing
the music through our movements with authenticity and heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our SYF journey taught us perseverance, teamwork, and the importance of
creative expression. It was never just about perfecting the choreography,
but about growing together — supporting one another, cultivating team synergy,
and bringing a shared artistic vision to life. As sisters in learning and
sisters at heart, each dancer played a vital role in our collective growth
and unity. We couldn’t be prouder of what we have accomplished together
as RGS DI.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We would like to thank our dancers for their unwavering dedication and
discipline over the past few months. Our deepest gratitude also goes to
our instructor, Ms Ng Jingwen, and our teachers-in-charge, Mdm Safiah Binte
Ani, Ms Sandi Kum, and Ms Lin Yao, for their constant support and guidance
throughout this journey.</p>

<p></p>
<p>For this year’s Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), our RGS Ethnic Dance (Indian
Dance) team presented 'Pamba Ganapathy', an energetic devotional piece
that pays homage to Lord Ganapathy — the beloved elephant-headed deity
revered as the remover of obstacles. Set in a fast-paced Bharatanatyam
style, the performance artfully blended traditional movements with stylised
choreography, capturing the essence of devotion, grace, and strength. Accompanied
by vibrant and rhythmic music, the piece radiated both power and poise,
earning the team a Distinction.
<br>
<br>This journey has been rigorous yet incredibly rewarding. As I reflect
on our experiences, I’m proud of how we have grown — not just as dancers,
but as resilient individuals and supportive teammates, always ready to
uplift and encourage one another.

<p>After months of dedication and countless hours of practice, the RGS Guitar
Ensemble can finally bid farewell to the SYF season—on a high note! Every
member gave their best to deliver a performance they can truly be proud
of. We are thrilled to share that we ended it with a bang, clinching a
Distinction.
<br>
<br>A big thank you as well to all the parents and supporters who attended
our performances—your presence and encouragement meant so much to us.

<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p></p>
<p>Our talented Handbell Ensemble took the stage at the Singapore Youth Festival
(SYF) Arts Presentation, delivering a performance that showcased both their
musicality and versatility earning them a Distinction! 🎶🔔
<br>
<br>They captivated the audience with a stunning rendition of Mozart’s Fantasy
No. 2 in C Minor, bringing out the depth and elegance of this classical
masterpiece.
<br>
<br>Ending on a high-energy note, they switched gears to the upbeat Rock Around
The Clock by Bill Haley &amp; His Comets—an electrifying contrast that
had the crowd tapping along! 🎸🎵
<br>
<br>“Since last year, our numerous practices have not only helped us grow
musically, but also strengthened our bond as a team. When faced with challenges—like
tackling tricky rhythms—we supported one another through clear communication:
counting together, tapping the tempo, and offering constructive feedback.
We overcame those hurdles together, and we did it!” Handbell Ensemble 2025</p>

<p></p>
<p>1) Raffles Drama (Team A) presented “Sarah is Typing…” , an original piece
written in English, exploring the growing impact of Internet addiction
and hyperconnectivity.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Through this piece, we hope to strike a personal chord that impacts many
who use social media. The strained relationship between Sarah and her mother
also added an emotional element of empathetic exchange.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rehearsals were a journey of artistic and personal growth. Our CCA Member
who were involved in Ensemble, Props and Sets, Costumes and Makeup, and
Lights and Sounds contributed to the creative process, making it a truly
collaborative production.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re grateful to our teachers-in-charge, Ms Sharon Ong, Ms Ivy Toh, and
Mdm Liu Huan Qing, whose support carried us through. Our coaches, Ms Serena,
Mr Rodney, and Han Laoshi, were instrumental in sharpening our craft and
guiding us through creative roadblocks. Thank you as well to our parents
and friends for their continued support.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A growth experience was Arts Assembly, which helped us identify many loopholes
and helped us revamp our entire performance before SYF. A meaningful moment
was our pre-SYF run for Team B, whose encouragement reminded us of the
strength of our community. The friendships and collaboration that emerged
from SYF serve as a quiet reminder for our CCA to trust each other and
perform with one heart.</p>

<p></p>
<p>2) For this year’s Singapore Youth Festival, Raffles Drama Team B presented
《“逃”花源》Escape to Utopia, an original Chinese-language theatre piece that
delves into the theme of pressure among youths. The narrative introduces
Utopia—a paradise seemingly free from life’s burdens. But as the story
unfolds, it prompts us to question: Is paradise truly perfect? Is a life
without struggle really worth living?</p>
<p></p>
<p>This theme resonated deeply with us. Whether the pressure stems from school,
competition, or family expectations, many of us grapple with the dilemma
of whether to confront our challenges head-on or escape from them.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our rehearsal process was instrumental in uniting all our committees—Directors,
Cast, Props and Sets, and Lights and Sounds. Through clear communication
and active collaboration, we were able to bring together each element into
a seamless, cohesive performance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>A particularly meaningful moment was our pre-SYF showcase for Team A.
Hearing that they found our story touching and relatable reminded us of
the emotional power that theatre holds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Throughout our journey, we were deeply grateful for the support and guidance
of our teachers—Ms Ong, Ms Toh, and Mdm Liu. The creative direction provided
by our coaches, Han Laoshi, Ms Serena and Mr Rodney, was a constant beacon.
Most importantly, it was the trust we placed in one another that carried
us through.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This experience was more than just a performance, it was a reflection
of our growth, both as individuals and as a team.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Over the past few months, our members have been diligently practising
for SYF. Even though we faced many challenges along the way, the ensemble
remained optimistic throughout the busy SYF season, committing wholeheartedly
to the collective effort of the CCA.</p>
<p>It was certainly not easy to improve within such a short period of time,
and RGS SE could not have done it without the unwavering support of our
instructors, teachers, family, and friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’re proud to share that all the hard work paid off — RGS String Ensemble
achieved a Distinction at SYF!</p>

<p>Thank you, everyone!</p>
