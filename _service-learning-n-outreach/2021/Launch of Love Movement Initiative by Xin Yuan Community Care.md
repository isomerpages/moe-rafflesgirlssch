## Launch of Love Movement Initiative by Xin Yuan Community Care

Our long-time community partner in Toa Payoh, Xin Yuan Community Care, launched their ‘Love Movement Initiative’ on 20 March. The event was graced by Dato Seri Utama Dr Philip Soon (DBA), who shared with guests his life experiences and philosophy towards volunteerism. Xin Yuan Community Care also presented various partners with a plaque to commemorate the partnership. Our Art Club brought cheer to the event by emceeing the session and facilitating an art workshop for the elderly.   

We are happy that the event was a success and honoured to be a part of Xin Yuan Community Care’s Love Movement Initiative. We look forward to deepening our roots in Braddell-Toa Payoh with our community partners!
