<p>The EGOI is an international competition for young women passionate about
Computer Science. It is modelled after the International Olympiad in Informatics,
and the Singapore team was selected from the top female participants of
the National Olympiad in Informatics (NOI).</p>
<p>We would also like to congratulate our alumnae, Cao Leyi (Class of 2023)
and Foo Kai Qin (Class of 2024), who achieved Bronze and Silver respectively.</p>
