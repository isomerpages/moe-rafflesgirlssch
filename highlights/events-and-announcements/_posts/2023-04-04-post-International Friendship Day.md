We commemorated International Friendship Day on 4 April 2023, celebrating the power of friendship and the amazing diversity it brings. To mark this special occasion, we invited our Year 3 ASEAN scholars, Le Nhu Ahn and Le Dieu Ahn from Vietnam, and Suphaphit Rungruanghiranya from Thailand, to share their unique cultures with everyone in school. 
  
Our Year 3 Regional Studies Programme (RSP) student emcees, Jeanette, Runfang, and Clarice, also shed light on this year's IFD theme, which is "Singapore in Asia". They emphasised the importance of our country's role in shaping the region and fostering strong bonds with our neighbours.  
  
On this day, let us appreciate our friends from various cultures and walks of life, and embrace the diversity and vibrancy that make us unique. Let's promote the spirit of friendship and collaboration as we celebrate this occasion, and even thereafter.
