As part of an in-house Values-in-Action activity organised by our Community Youth Leadership students, our Year 1s participated in a school clean-up activity earlier this afternoon (22 September 2020) to better support our elderly cleaners' and our estate crewâ€™s work. Representatives from each Year 1 class also presented hand-written notes of appreciation to the estate crew to thank them for their service to the school.
