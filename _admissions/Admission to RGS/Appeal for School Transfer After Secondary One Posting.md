## Appeal for School Transfer After Secondary One Posting

#### Application Period and Eligibility

Application for Appeal to Transfer to RGS after Secondary One Posting 2023 is meant for Primary 6 students who have sat for the PSLE in 2022.

Students who have been posted to a school via DSA-Sec Exercise are **NOT** allowed to participate in this Appeal Exercise as they are expected to honour their commitment to the posted DSA school for the duration of the programme that they were admitted into.

Please note that each year, only a small number of students, if any, will be admitted through this appeal exercise as RGS is not at liberty to create additional spaces in the school.

Late or incomplete applications will not be considered.  
  
Admissions through the Appeal Exercise will be based on objective and transparent measures of academic merit, i.e. PSLE performance before they can be considered. Students are required to meet RGS cut-off point before they can be considered for the transfer.  

Students who wish to gain admission to RGS on the basis of other talents and achievements would have had the option of participating in the Direct Schools Admissions (DSA) Exercise, which were conducted and concluded in September. 
Successful applicants will be notified via phone call or e-mail. Hence, applicants must be reachable by phone at the local number(s) provided on the application.

The application will be deemed incomplete and will not be considered if applicant cannot be contacted or are unable to produce the original documents for verification purposes upon request.
