<p>Over the years, our students have actively contributed to the well-being
of the local community, engaging in meaningful service that extends beyond
the classroom. As part of Learning Journeys (LJ) Week, our Year 1s were
introduced to Service-Learning through the <em>What’s in My Backyard</em> initiative—a
programme designed to deepen their understanding of the community, particularly
the elderly, and to nurture a sense of empathy and responsibility as active
citizens.</p>

<p>Our girls had the invaluable opportunity to interact with residents across
various neighbourhoods, including Braddell-Toa Payoh, Commonwealth, Tanglin
Halt, Margaret Drive, and Marsiling. Working in partnership with long-standing
community organisations such as:</p>

</ul>
<p>Through hands-on activities, the girls contributed in various ways, including
home cleaning for seniors to improve their living conditions, and engaging
them through mini carnivals and arts and crafts sessions. Many students
reflected on how meaningful it was to interact with the elderly—initial
nerves gave way to heartfelt conversations, and they came away moved by
the warmth and resilience of the seniors. Some expressed a new appreciation
for how small acts of kindness could bring comfort and joy to others.</p>
<p>We were also heartened by the involvement of our parent volunteers, who
played a vital role in chaperoning and supporting the students. Many parents
joined in the home cleaning efforts, working alongside their children to
uplift the lives of seniors in the community. These intergenerational efforts
created shared moments of service and strengthened community bonds.</p>
<p>Back on campus, the girls shifted their focus to acknowledging the contributions
of another often-unsung group— the school’s own cleaning staff. By stepping
into their shoes and taking on daily cleaning duties—tidying classrooms,
the library, school canteen, and even toilets—students were challenged
to reflect on the labour that goes into creating a clean and safe school
environment. For many, this was a moment of realisation. Several shared
how physically tiring the tasks were and how it gave them newfound respect
for the dedication of the school’s support staff.</p>
<p>These experiences serve as an early and impactful stepping stone in our
students’ journey towards becoming Daughters of a Better Age—young individuals
committed to uplifting others with empathy, purpose, and a heart for the
community.</p>

put in, recognising that most of them may be doing such chores for the
first time. On the whole, the students have a very good attitude - willing
to try out even if it’s out of their comfort zone.</div>
