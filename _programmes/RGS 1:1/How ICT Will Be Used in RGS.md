## How ICT Will Be Used in RGS

ICT will be used in RGS during class time and beyond to:

**1 \.**       **Activate Learning**

*   Students access different types of media – text, videos, images, models, simulations, animations
*   Students are oriented towards the learning objectives either before a lesson at home or at the start of a lesson in class
*   Teachers can make lesson materials available online through online platforms such as Edmodo or the RGS Google Domain
*   Teachers can conduct a survey or put up an online quiz to gather information on prior knowledge on a topic they are about to start teaching
*   Teachers can provide task environments that represent and simulate real-world problems, situations and contexts
-Micro-worlds and simulations<br>
-Virtual/augmented reality<br>
-Role-play simulations
*   Students have access to online libraries, databases and search engines and can learn independently or be directed to specific sources by their teachers
*   Students can communicate with the teacher online to inform on what they have already learned, and what they would like to know more about even before a lesson starts
*   Students set goals and targets and organise their own learning (e.g. wikis, blogs, online calendars, email)

**2 \.**       **Promote Thinking and Discussion**

*   Students gather live data in authentic contexts
*   Probes (provided by the school) are used in some subjects
*   Students conduct field work using ICT devices for input
*   Students analyse, evaluate and synthesise multiple types of information (e.g. graphic organisers, mind-maps, spreadsheets)
*   Students collaborate with their peers both within their class synchronously as well as beyond the class, asynchronously
*   Students collaborate with peers from other classes
*   Students at times, collaborate with students from other schools and even from other countries
*   Students have access to teachers without having to meet them face-to-face
*   Students have access to experts beyond the school

**3 \.**       **Facilitate Demonstration of Learning**

*   Students create digital products (e.g. video editing software, authoring tools for infographics, slideshows, animations, websites, blogs, e-books, e-portfolios)
*   Students can share/communicate information to demonstrate what they have learned with peers, experts, parents and their teachers

**4 \.**       **Monitor and Provide Feedback**

*   Teachers can check for understanding using students’ works in different media
*   Teachers can give timely and targeted feedback – this would be both generic, directed to the class as a whole, as well as targeted at individual students
*   If exercises are done online, real-time feedback can be provided, especially with automated quizzes and adaptive learning tools such as through ACE Learning in Mathematics
*   Students can also obtain feedback from peers or experts or even from their parents
*   Students are encouraged to give feedback to others
*   Students document their learning journey and reflect on goals and learning processes
*   Students can track their own progress
*   Students can submit their work online through portals such as Turnitin
