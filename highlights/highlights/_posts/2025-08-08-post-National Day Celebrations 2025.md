<p>Sixty years young and still soaring! The Rafflesian family painted the
campus in a dazzling sea of red and white as we celebrated Singapore’s
milestone birthday. Pride, joy, and the Singapore Spirit shone through
every smile, song, and cheer as we marked this special moment in our nation’s
story.</p>
<p>The festivities began with a ceremonial parade led by our uniformed groups.
We were honoured to welcome Ms Wu Ye-Min (Class of 1997) as our Guest of
Honour. We were also delighted to have representatives from the Parents
for RGS Association join us in the celebration. This year, we also hosted
students and staff from Singapore Japanese Secondary School, who added
to the camaraderie of the occasion. The parade concluded with the singing
of our National Anthem followed by the recital of our pledge in all four
official languages.</p>
<p>The concert segment was a burst of colour, music, and creativity, featuring
the much-loved “LoveSG” skits and “We Are SG” performances. Year 4 classes
entertained the audience with witty and heartwarming stories that celebrated
the Singapore Spirit. Students also put together impressive props that
brought each performance to life and added to the festive atmosphere. The
celebration ended on a high note with a heartfelt community sing-along
of our favourite National Day songs.</p>
<p>This year’s theme, “Majulah Singapura”, is more than just our National
Anthem. It is a call that has rallied generations to rise, rebuild, and
reach higher together. As we celebrate 60 years of independence, may we
continue to move forward with hope, courage, unity, and the values that
bind us as one people.</p>
<p>Happy 60th Birthday, Singapore! Here’s to the next chapter of our shared
journey.</p>
