<p>Our girls participated in the <em>Bulky Waste to Wonder Competition 2024</em>,
a challenge that encourages sustainable practices through creative repurposing.
In preparation, they attended workshops led by industry designers and local
startups, gaining valuable insights into how waste can be transformed into
functional and beautiful furniture.</p>

<p>The RGS team demonstrated their creativity with the <em>GreenCanvas Cabinet</em>,
securing 3rd place in the competition. Their project gave a second life
to a discarded meeting table, transforming it into accessible storage designed
for seniors at New Life Community Services. This thoughtful creation promotes
creativity by providing easy access to craft materials within the community.</p>
<p>The competition encouraged participants to take ownership of waste management
by rethinking, reusing, and redesigning bulky items. It reinforced the
importance of making sustainable choices and reducing waste at its source.</p>
<p>Together, we <em>"Clean It Forward for Better SG"</em>!</p>
