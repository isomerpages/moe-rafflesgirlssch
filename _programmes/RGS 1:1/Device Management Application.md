## Device Management Application

**Device Management Application Installation**  

*   Your child’s/ward’s PLD will be installed with a Device Management Application (DMA) to provide a safer digital environment for learning.      
*   Installation of the DMA will be performed after the collection of the device. Students will be guided on the installation.    
*   This applies to both devices purchased through the school and pre-existing student-owned devices.   
*   The DMA will be funded by MOE and will be uninstalled from the device when your child/ward graduates/leaves the school.

**In-School DMA Settings (Default)**<br>
Schools will determine DMA settings for in-school use. As a default, these settings will continue to be in place after school as well:

*   MOE and the school will set the level of web content filtering, including filtering out objectionable content or content that may not be conducive to teaching and learning (e.g. social media, pornography, gambling, or websites containing extremist content)  
*   Students will be able to use the device from <06.00 a.m. to 11 p.m.> (to be decided by the school) daily  
*   The school will determine the apps and programs to be installed to support teaching and learning
