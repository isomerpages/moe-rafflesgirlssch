## Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Youth)

In this year's edition of the Singapore Energy Grand Challenge (Youth), students were invited to form teams of 2-4 students, and develop creative and impactful submissions based on the challenge statement "How would your carbon-free school, or neighbourhood in Singapore look like in 2050?" Participating teams had to develop their submissions using Minecraft, and submit a 3-minute video.

Of the 10 participating RGS teams, four teams were shortlisted for the semi-finals (the four semi-finalist teams are listed below). The semi-finalists attended a virtual clinic session designed to them understand Singaporeâ€™s Energy Story, the Energy Trilemma, and to learn useful Minecraft: Education Edition (M:EE) skills that would aid them in the final submission:

**Team VPOG**<br>\- Chloe Ong Si Yi (407)<br>\- Park Juha (413)<br>\- Shen Xintian (414)<br>\- Teo Gi Min (414)

**Team 3R**<br>\- Victoria Teo Yue Tong (101)<br>\- Tan Xuan Ying (107)<br>\- Kong Zi Yau Bernadette (108)

**Team Phrog**<br>\- Huang Anqi Annie (201)<br>\- Noorul Nuhaa Binti Shawal (201)<br>\- Chen Ying (202)<br>\- Yu Yiqia (202)

**Team ProtoEco**<br>\- Lin Qianyu (313)<br>\- Tan Min Min (314)
