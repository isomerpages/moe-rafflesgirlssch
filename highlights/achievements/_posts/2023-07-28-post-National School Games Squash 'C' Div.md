Congratulations to our Squash 'C' Div girls for their exceptional performance and emerging as champions in the Nationals!

**Reflection by team captain:**

I am extremely proud and overjoyed with my team when our efforts had paid off as we triumphed and clinched gold, alongside our B-division team seniors. Even though there were quite a few challenges along the way, our team remained adaptable and hopeful, walking into every court with a determined mindset, regardless of how skilful our opponents were. I remember all the training we’ve had to prepare for this year’s competition, ranging from tiring, vigorous fitness sessions, to fun, friendly matches on the court. It was truly motivating to see all the hard work, passion and dedication each of my teammates poured into each session. After seeing our seniors defend their title for the second consecutive year, our team took it as a challenge for ourselves to reach that same goal, and pushed ourselves to persevere when facing any obstacle. It was really heart-warming to see everyone reaching their fullest potential, and each of us encouraging one another throughout the competition season. Through this experience, we have not only created many unforgettable memories which we would forever cherish, but also strengthened our team spirit when cheering one another on during each match. After gaining victory for the second consecutive year, we have been able to prove that we could and will continue to bring pride and honour to our team, school and sport.
