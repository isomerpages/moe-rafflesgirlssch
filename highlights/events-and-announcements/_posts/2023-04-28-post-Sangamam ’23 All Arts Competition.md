Our Tamil Language students participated in the inter school’ Sangamam ’23 All Arts Competition’ organised by the Raffles Institution Indian Cultural Society (ICS). We’re proud to share that 2 out of 3 teams made it to the finals and won the Sangamam Challenge Trophy, the Tamil Couplet recital (1st runner up) and the Fusion Dance (Champions) segment.

One of our girls was also featured on Mediacorp’s ‘Indian Beat’. (5.55mins onward)
