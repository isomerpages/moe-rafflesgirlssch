<p>Inspired by Inside Out, this year’s celebration was a tribute to the emotions
that colour our journey and the teachers and staff whose dedication turns
those emotions into opportunities for growth, learning, and belonging at
RGS.</p>
<p>The celebration was filled with heartfelt gratitude and uplifting performances
by our talented students and our staff too, who wowed everyone with their
energy and talent as the staff band took the stage. Teachers were also
recognised with special awards, a reminder of the countless ways they enrich
our school community.</p>
<p>As we celebrate Teachers’ Day, we give thanks for the people who nurture,
inspire, and guide us with heart and soul. Thank you, dear teachers and
staff, for shaping the next generation of Daughters of a Better Age.</p>
<p>Happy Teachers’ Day. You truly are the heart of RGS.</p>
