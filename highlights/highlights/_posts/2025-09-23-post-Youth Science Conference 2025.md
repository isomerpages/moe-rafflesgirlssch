<p>The Youth Science Conference (YSC) is an annual event organised by the
Gifted Education Branch, MOE, for students involved in scientific research
under either the Science Mentorship Programme (SMP) or the School-Based
Science Mentorship Programme (SB-SMP).</p>
<p>The 31<sup>st</sup> YSC was held virtually on 19 September 2025. and showcased
9 SMP projects and 20 SB-SMP projects from RGS. In addition, the RGS SMP
team consisting of Audrey Chee Yao Rui (S312) and Tan Yi Yin Zoie (S313)
were one of three SMP and SB-SMP projects that were selected to present
their project to the audience in attendance at the online conference.</p>
<p>We congratulate all the RGS teams for their outstanding performance!

<h4>Student Reflections</h4>
<blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>“Our SMP journey was filled with trial and error. Many of our initial
solutions failed and we often had to go back to adjust approaches and techniques.
It was frustrating at times, but these difficulties pushed us to think
critically and explore new concepts, like microencapsulation. Through setbacks,
we learnt perseverance, teamwork, and adaptability. More importantly, we
realised that failure is part of research, and this has pushed us beyond
textbook knowledge into real-life scientific discovery.”</p>
<p>Tan Yi Yin Zoie (S313)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Throughout our SB-SMP journey, we faced many challenges, our inconclusive
data and tight schedules causing significant setbacks. Yet, we persevered
together, supporting and encouraging oneanother. YSC was one highlight
of our journey, where we presented our year’s work to judges who were experts
in their fields. All in all, this journey has been truly fulfilling, shaping
us as researchers. Special thanks to Dr Lim, our mentor, for her invaluable
guidance throughout this meaningful experience.”</p>
