In support of MOE's efforts to promote student learning and appreciation of Mother Tongue Languages and cultures, our RGS Languages Department organised our very own Mother Tongue Fortnight for the whole of Term 1 Week 5 and 8.  
  
This year's theme is "Cultural Kaleidoscope" aims to foster in our students the passion for cultural learning through a series of diverse activities. These activities serve as the "lenses" in a kaleidoscope, offering students a hands-on opportunity to learn about various cultures using their Mother Tongue Languages. Through this approach, we hope to strengthen their connection and sense of belonging to their cultural heritage, as well as to deepen their appreciation for their role within their respective societies.
  
Our students took part in a variety of activities, such as learning about the traditional Malay music genre of *Dikir Barat*, attending a session with the Malay Society Alumnae, performing the Tamil folk dance *Kolattam*, experiencing the Indian folk percussion performance called *Parai Adithal*, participating in a Chinese knot workshop, exploring tea appreciation, joining a dumpling-making workshop led by our Chinese Language Teacher Mdm Mu Jun, watching a movie screening of "The Kid from the Big Apple" and singing along to Mandarin pop songs by local band CurryPop.
