I wish to place on record my deepest thanks to all the Council Members, past and present, in particular 2nd Council President Ms Patricia Liu, Treasurer Ms Joyce Ho and Council Member Dr Gan Su-lin for their commitment and dedication in serving their alma mater. We extend a warm welcome to new Council Members Ms Ting Hui Shan, Ms Gu Weite and Dr Goh Su-Yen. 

We wish to thank RGSA 2nd Council, too, for raising more than $100,000 for the school, from their sponsorship and donations to the Movie Night and “Carnival Memorias”, the sale of the Filiae Bear and other memorabilia, and the ORA Fundraising Golf in which $102,000 was raised for the RGS New Campus Development Fund.

Many activities were organised to connect generations of RGS girls, inspiring them to give back to the school in different ways including serving as resource persons for RGS Career Day and providing internships and job attachments for students. “Chic Chats” continue to be popular events for members to meet and network in a casual setting, at food establishments owned by alumnae. As so is the RGSA “Chic Chefs” series – started in 2017 – whereby budding Rafflesian chefs and food enthusiasts were treated to a nostalgic experience of baking in the school’s Home Economics kitchen.

We congratulate Ms Lee Twe Jeog and Dr Tan Wei Ching on being elected as President and Vice-president respectively.

I am confident that the RGS Alumnae under their leadership will inspire, engage and translate vision into reality, and continue to provide opportunities for RGS girls to serve the alma mater, nation and society.
