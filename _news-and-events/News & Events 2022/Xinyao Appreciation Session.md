## Xinyao Appreciation Session

Our Year 1 students (those taking Chinese and Higher Chinese) sat down for a Xinyao Appreciation Session at the school's auditorium on 20 April 2022. Through the session, they were able to better understand the evolution and progression of our local Singaporean culture and concurrently, develop a better appreciation for the Chinese Language.  
  
'Xinyao' (新谣) refers to a repertoire of Mandarin songs composed, written and performed by young Singaporeans. Its roots can be traced back to the late 1970s, when many students began writing songs in Mandarin to express their thoughts and feelings.
