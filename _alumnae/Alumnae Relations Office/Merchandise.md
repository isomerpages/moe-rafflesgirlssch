Food is integral to our lives. It perpetuates our heritage and connects people. We share food whenever we come together, whether at a party for six or a feast for sixty. What more delectable way to honour our alma mater than with a beautifully crafted celebratory cookbook? Entitled “Consuming Passion: Memories From The Rafflesian Table”, this book is a stylish and heart-warming legacy of gastronomic treasures. Distinguished alumnae, current and past teachers and principals have generously shared their delicious family heirloom recipes. &nbsp;  

Consuming Passion was officially launched on 9 March 2013 at a Gala Tea in the school hall. All proceeds from the sale of Consuming Passion will go towards supporting the development of performing arts in RGS. The book is available for purchase at the General Office, Raffles Girls’ School (Secondary) on Monday to Friday, during office hours or&nbsp;[The RGS Shop](https://go.gov.sg/rgsshop). The retail price is S$30 (inclusive of GST) per copy, while stocks last.  

The book will make a beautiful and thoughtful gift for all occasions – birthdays, weddings, wonderful corporate gift for clients or for someone going abroad for further studies. &nbsp;  

The mouth-watering photos from the book won the Best in The Country (Singapore) title in the Photography category of the&nbsp;[Gourmand World Cookbooks Awards 2011](http://rgsconsumingpassion.wordpress.com/2012/01/02/happy-new-year-and-wonderful-news/). &nbsp;  

We look forward to your whole-hearted support.

I am the Filiae Bear. I am a “Daughter of a Better Age” who is grateful to the sub-committee of ladies, who in 1844 wanted a better life for me and so started a day school for 11 girls. As a daughter of my motherland, Singapore, I take to heart the exhortation of my school’s anthem not to fear what fortune sends and when I scale the heights of learning no mean desire my days shall shame. With my sisters in learning and sisters at heart, I will serve my motherland with pride and ardour. (standing/sitting bear, size: 22 cm in height, comes in a gift bag, specially &amp; lovingly curated to be sold to raise funds for our alma mater) The bear is available at&nbsp;[The RGS Shop](https://go.gov.sg/rgsshop).
