<p>The Young Defence Scientists Programme (YDSP) is a platform for DSO and
DSTA to engage students so as to promote awareness and generate interest
in defence science and technology. The annual&nbsp;YDSP&nbsp;Congress serves
as a platform to recognise students who participated in&nbsp;YDSP&nbsp;activities
in the previous year, and to recognise the recipients of the 2024&nbsp;YDSP&nbsp;and
DSTA JC scholarships.</p>
