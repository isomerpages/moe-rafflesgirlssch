## Teachers' Day Celebrations 2021

Schools around Singapore celebrated Teachers’ Day today on 2 Sept 2021 and RGS was no exception! 

The theme for this year’s Teacher Day Celebrations was Colour My World, which aims to convey how teachers have brought colours into the lives of the students! Everyone was encouraged to dress in their House Colours, which brought about a cheery atmosphere on a rainy morning. The celebrations comprised of both pre-recorded and live segments, which truly livened up the event and made it feel a lot less monotonous.
