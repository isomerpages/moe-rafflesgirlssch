## Mathematics

<img src="/images/maths.jpg" style="width:85%">

Our Mathematics curriculum is designed for our students to understand and apply mathematical concepts for effective problem solving. It is grounded in the view that the study of Mathematics is not just about rules and procedures, but also about seeking truth and beauty in patterns and logic, and solving problems which are modelled after real-life scenarios.

###### <center>Learning Outcomes</center>

*   Apply mathematical concepts, principles and logic to solve problems
*   Think independently, creatively and critically in the formulation of original and elegant solutions
*   Use Information and Communications Technology (ICT) to enhance learning
*   Acquire an appreciation of the beauty of Math, and the traits and dispositions of mathematicians
