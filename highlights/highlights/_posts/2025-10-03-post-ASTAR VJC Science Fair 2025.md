<p>Our girls recently took part in the A*STAR–VJC Science Fair, an annual
event jointly organised by the Agency for Science, Technology and Research
(A*STAR) and Victoria Junior College (VJC).</p>
<p>The fair encourages students to explore STEM through projects involving
experimentation, data collection, and research.</p>
<p>This year, four RGS teams joined the fair and achieved the following results:</p>

<h4>Student Reflection:</h4>
<p>“Our research project, Protein Profiling of Alzheimer’s-Model Drosophila
Using a Calibrated Bradford Assay for Early Neurodegeneration Detection,
explored a low-cost method for early detection and intervention of Alzheimer’s
disease using fruit fly models. In addition to conducting protein quantification
experiments, we developed a proof-of-concept algorithm that uses protein
concentration data to flag potential Alzheimer’s cases, paving the way
for future applications using biomarkers from urine, blood, or cerebrospinal
fluid. After months of experimentation and collaboration, we were proud
to present our findings at the VJC Science Fair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The journey wasn’t easy. From troubleshooting failed assays to coding
our own detection algorithm, there were many moments of doubt. Yet we persevered,
returning weekly (even on OWN days) for RA lab sessions. We are honoured
to receive Silver in the Upper Secondary Open category, and even more humbled
to be the only group personally recognised by the Guest of Honour, a senior
principal scientist at A*STAR. This experience has strengthened our passion
for research and shown us the immense potential of youth-led science and
innovation.”</p>
