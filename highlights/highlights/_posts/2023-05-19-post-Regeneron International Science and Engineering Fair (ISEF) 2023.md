 Here's their reflection:

*"We are extremely grateful to be given this opportunity to represent Singapore in ISEF 2023, held in Dallas, Texas and present our project Sign2Speak! Our research journey was definitely not smooth sailing where we faced numerous challenges and grew along the way. These challenges inspired us to continue utilising our engineering mindset to never stop improving. To our juniors who wish to pursue research, we highly encourage you to try this fulfilling experience and remember to embrace failure in order to improve. We would like to acknowledge our mentor, Dr Shen from DSO for guiding us along every step in our journey as well as our teachers, family and friends for believing in us."*
