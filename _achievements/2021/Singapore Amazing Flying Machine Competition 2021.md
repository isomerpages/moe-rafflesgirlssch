## Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition 2021

Eight RGS teams represented the school in Category B - Unpowered Gliders of the Singapore Amazing Flying Machine Competition (SAFMC) 2021, for which teams have to design and build small unpowered gliders to be bungee-launched in a bid to test the flight of their planes. The qualifying round involved a presentation via Zoom and the submission of a pre-competition video, while the final round involved the launch of their gliders.  
  
Eventually, two RGS teams were shortlisted for the final round and Team The Soaring Kiddos won first for the Most Creative and Aesthetic Award, while Team Era won first for the Best Video Award!
