## Overview

#### Admission to Year 1 – Direct School Admission (DSA)  

Introduced in 2004, the Direct School Admission (DSA) scheme provides students with the opportunity to seek admission to a secondary school, based on a diverse range of specific academic and non-academic achievements and talents that they can demonstrate beyond the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).  

Primary 6 (P6) students who do not participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise will continue to seek admission based on their PSLE results through the Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise.

Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the schools’ academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.  

Female Singaporean, Singapore PR and International Students who possess talents and achievements in a specific academic subject, a sport, music, visual art or demonstrate leadership in serving the school/community  are encouraged to apply for admission to RGS from May to June annually.

#### Admission to Year 1 – Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise & appeal for school transfer after secondary 1 (s1) posting

**Secondary 1 (S1) Posting Exercise**

The annual S1 Posting Exercise is conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to post Primary Six (P6) students from our mainstream schools who have passed their Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) to a secondary school taking into consideration their PSLE results, choice of schools and available vacancies.

**Appeal for School Transfer after Secondary 1 (S1) Posting**

The appeal for School Transfer after Secondary 1 (S1) Posting will take place after the MOE S1 Posting.

Posting and application for transfer takes place annually in December.

Primary 6 female students in the local mainstream schools who have participated in the MOE S1 Posting Exercise, may appeal to be considered for transfer to RGS. Students who appeal for transfer must meet the school's cut-off point for that year, and admission of such students is subjected to available vacancies.    

NOTE: Students who have already gained admission into a secondary school via DSA or AEIS are not allowed to participate in the S1 Posting Exercise and Appeal for School Transfer after Secondary 1 (S1) Posting.
