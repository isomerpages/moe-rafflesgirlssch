#### Help Us Keep in Touch

Dear Sisters-at-Heart,

We warmly invite you to be part of the RGS Alumnae database as we continue building meaningful connections within the RGS family and beyond.

The short 10-minute&nbsp;[survey](http://go.gov.sg/rgsalumnaeupdateofinformation)&nbsp;([http://go.gov.sg/rgsalumnaeupdateofinformation](http://go.gov.sg/rgsalumnaeupdateofinformation)) consists of two parts: 1) your profile and 2) alumnae engagement. It will help us stay in touch, share updates, and invite you to contribute to various school initiatives.

All information will be kept confidential and used by the RGS Alumnae Relations Office to enhance your engagement with the school and its community.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us at&nbsp;[aro@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg](mailto:aro@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg).

Thank you for being a valued part of our Sisters-at-Heart network.

Warm regards,

RGS Alumnae Office (ARO)
