## HUSH-STEM Week 2021

As part of HUSH-STEM Week 2021, the Indoor Farm Learning Journey was held in RGS' very own Food Lab! Conducted by Mr Darren Ho, a modern-day agriculturalist from his own company, Petalicious Farm, our students were excited to learn more of how Singapore aspires to achieve her own food sustainability in the future. In fact, our students all had the chance to be farmers as they got to take home a personal micro green growing kit.

HUSH-STEM Week is an annual event jointly organised by the RGS Science and Humanities departments. This year, it took place from 16-23 February. Through the series of activities that our students took part in during the week, we hope that they come to understand the importance of STEM for Humanity, and more specifically, how the issue of food security and food sustainability is a shared endeavour for survival in Singapore and around the world.
