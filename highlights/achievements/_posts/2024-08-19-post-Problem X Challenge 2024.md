<p>Problem X (PX) Challenge is a programme jointly organised by the Gifted
Education Branch, Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore University
of Technology and Design (SUTD). Incepted in 2020, the programme targets
Year 2 to 4 students who demonstrate strong aptitude, passion and motivation
for inquiry in Science and Mathematics.</p>

<p>The focus for PX Challenge 2024 centers on dengue fever, recognising its
status as a significant global public health concern. Participants will
assume the role of public health researchers tasked with examining various
aspects of the virus, including its epidemiology, transmission trend, geographical
and demographics impact, and intervention strategies. Based on their findings,
students will compile a technical report and produce an online video bulletin
to create awareness of the virus and educate the community on the steps
to take to fight dengue and protect their health and environment.</p>
