On behalf of RGS, I wish to place on record my deepest thanks to all the Exco Members, past and present, in particular Council Members Ms Chua Yi Wen and Ms Celeste Lim for their commitment and dedication in serving their alma mater. We extend a warm welcome to new Exco Members Ms May Ang Peck Ngo and Ms Jennifer Loh Nee Sian.

We wish to thank RGSA, too, for raising more than $100,000 - from the sale of the Filiae Bear, RGSA scarf and other memorabilia, and from the ORA Fundraising Golf - for the RGS New Campus Development Fund. We are also grateful to RGSA for co-organising the hugely successful RGS 140 Homecoming, sponsoring the RGS Alumnae Award presented on Founder’s Day and for the lovely bouquet of flowers given us on Teachers’ Day.

Many activities were organised to connect generations of RGS girls, inspiring them to give back to the school in different ways including serving as resource persons for RGS Career Day and providing internships and job attachments for students. “Chic Chats” continue to be popular events for members to meet and network in a casual setting, at food establishments owned by alumnae. The inaugural Rafflesian Women’s Conference was inspiring as it was affirming.

We congratulate Ms Lee Twe Jeog and Ms Mabel Tay serving as President and Vice-president respectively.

I am confident that the RGS Alumnae, under their leadership will inspire, engage and translate vision into reality, and continue to provide opportunities for RGS girls to serve the alma mater, nation and society.

Ms Haslinda Zamani
