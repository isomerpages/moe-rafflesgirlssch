## RGS Alumnae

Registered as a society on 22 July 2014, the [RGS Alumnae](http://rgsalumnae.com/) (RGSA) seeks to connect members with RGS girls to inspire, enable and engage these Daughters of a Better Age across the years as ambassadors for education and egalitarianism.  
To that end, the RGSA has embarked on several initiatives to raise money for the RGS New Campus Development Fund in preparation for RGS’ move to its new Braddell campus. The RGSA also supports and promotes the growth and development of RGS students through the RGS Alumnae Award, which is awarded to two selected Year 3 students every year starting from 2015. This award gives outstanding students a chance to receive personal career mentoring and guidance from our alumnae based on their interests. To promote interaction and allow former RGS girls to relive their school day memories together, events such as Chic Chats are organised, which, as the name suggests, allows them to catch up over drinks in a casual setting. Networking sessions such as Straight Talk also provide opportunities for RGS girls to share their career expertise and personal experiences.

These are some of the projects undertaken to promote RGSA as

*   a community embodying the Rafflesian spirit and values that provides mentoring to students, teachers and fellow          members;
*   a collective that actively shares experiences and works toward the betterment of society, nation and self; and
*   a kindred commitment to shaping and achieving the goals of RGS.

The RGS Alumnae will continue to provide a platform for alumnae to connect with each other and with students of RGS, and will offer support to and work with the School to promote and develop a community embodying the Rafflesian spirit and values and contribute to shaping and achieving the goals of RGS.
