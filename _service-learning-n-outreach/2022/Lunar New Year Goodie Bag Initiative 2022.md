## Lunar New Year Goodie Bag Initiative 2022

<img src="/images/svc1.jpeg" style="width:85%">

For the second-year running, the RGS Languages Department led a school-wide Lunar New Year Goodie Bag initiative in hopes of spreading some festive cheer to the beneficiaries of Xin Yuan Community Care Centre.  
  
The 150 goodie bags, containing essential items and festive goodies, and sealed with specially-designed greeting cards, were each packed by RGS students and staff working within their classes and departments. They were then hand-delivered by some of our student representatives and members of our Senior Management team.
