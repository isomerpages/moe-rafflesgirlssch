<p>Our Year 3 student leaders were officially invested into their new leadership
roles at this year’s Student Leaders’ Investiture on 12 August 2025. We
were honoured to welcome Ms Sharon Chan Zi Yin (Class of 2008) as our Guest
of Honour.</p>
<p>The theme for this year’s investiture, “Different Stories, One Heartbeat”,
reflects the diversity of experiences, talents and perspectives our student
leaders bring, united by a shared purpose to serve the Rafflesian community.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all our newly appointed student leaders. Lead with
courage, empathy and integrity, knowing that your actions can inspire and
uplift others. To our outgoing student leaders, we express our deepest
gratitude for the time, energy and heart you have poured into your roles,
and for the many ways you have enriched the Rafflesian community.</p>
