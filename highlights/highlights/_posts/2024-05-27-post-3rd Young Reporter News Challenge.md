<p>We congratulate Tan Yi Yin Zoie for attaining the Silver Award at the
3rd Young Reporter News Challenge 2024!</p>
<p>Jointly organised by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning
(CPCLL), MediaCorp 8world, Speak Mandarin Campaign, with support from the
Singapore Centre for Chinese Language, the competition aims to develop
students’ interest and ability to communicate and present in Mandarin,
as well as their media literacy skills.</p>
<p>Zoie Tan participated in the Fresh News Category, where she was tasked
to present a news piece of about 1-2 minutes long. With the hope of raising
awareness about autism to foster a more inclusive society, her news report
focused on how people with autism are no different from all of us and they
too can find success in their talents and lead meaningful lives.</p>
