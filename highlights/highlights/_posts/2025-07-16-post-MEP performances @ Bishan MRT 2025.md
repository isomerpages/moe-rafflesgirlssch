<p>In the lead-up to our Nation’s 60th birthday, our talented Music Elective
Programme (MEP) students brought cheer to commuters at Bishan MRT with
a vibrant live performance.</p>
<p>From heartfelt renditions of National Day classics like Where I Belong
(Tanya Chua) and Reach Out for the Skies (Rui En &amp; Taufik), to beloved
local tunes such as 细水长流 by Liang Wern Fook and 如燕 by Olivia Ong, our girls
captivated passers-by with their musicality and spirit. A special highlight
was their creative take on the Evolution of NDP Songs.</p>
<p>The performance featured an interesting mix of instruments, pairing traditional
and modern sounds to create a uniquely Singaporean blend, reflective of
our nation’s diverse heritage and evolving identity.</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone who stopped by to show their support, to our
dedicated MEP teachers for their mentorship, and to the SMRT team for making
the arrangements possible.</p>
