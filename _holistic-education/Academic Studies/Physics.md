## Physics

The curriculum is designed to provide the breadth of study in theoretical and experimental physics necessary for our learners to make informed decisions in the pursuit of physics-dependent disciplines. It also allows for the depth of study that leads to an understanding of the physical world, using fundamental physics concepts and principles. In this way, our students become confident and contributing citizens in a technological world, guided by a keen sense of curiosity, and refined by critical and creative thinking.
