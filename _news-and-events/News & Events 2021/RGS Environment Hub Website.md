## RGS Environment Hub Website

In the lead-up to Earth Week 2021 on 19 April, our students from Cogitare Club (the Mathematics, Science and Environmental CCA in RGS) have put together a virtual Environment Hub to spread their love for the environment and the sciences by highlighting the many school-wide initiatives such as the Butterfly Garden planning, Earth Week and numerous Values-in-Action projects aimed at improving the environment within the school.  
  
Visit their website [here](https://sites.google.com/rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg/cogitare/home?authuser=0) to find out more about the latest initiatives and to keep yourself updated on what to expect for the upcoming Earth Week 2021!
