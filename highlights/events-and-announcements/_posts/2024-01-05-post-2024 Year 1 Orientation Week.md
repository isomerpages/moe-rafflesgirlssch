<p><strong>Welcome Year 1s!</strong>
</p>
<p>Marking the start of their Rafflesian journey, our Year 1s participated
in a fun-filled Orientation Week programme from 2-5 January specially planned
by their seniors from the Leadership Boards. The week-long programme culminated
in the Year 1 Orientation Concert, with each class presenting an original
performance based on the orientation theme ‘One Heart, One Voice’, and
the RGS Initiation Ceremony, where the Year 1s are presented to their parents
for the first time as full-fledged RGS students.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures from the week-long orientation programme:</p>
