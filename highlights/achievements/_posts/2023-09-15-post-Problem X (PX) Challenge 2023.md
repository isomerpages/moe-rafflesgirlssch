Problem X (PX) Challenge is a programme jointly organised by the Gifted Education Branch, Ministry of Education (MOE) and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). Incepted in 2020, the programme targets Year 2 to 4 students who demonstrate strong aptitude, passion and motivation for inquiry in Science and Mathematics.

The focus for PX Challenge 2023 was regarding Green Energy and Sustainability — Hydrogen Gas as an alternative energy source. Students were tasked to produce a technical report to identify knowledge gaps of secondary school students about hydrogen fuel, explain the science of hydrogen production and utilisation, and produce a 15-minute video to educate peers on the viability of hydrogen as an energy source for Singapore.  
  
RGS registered five teams for the competition, of which one team was shortlisted for the finals. Under the guidance of their RGS teacher-mentors, the RGS team was achieved the Commendation award. Two other teams received a special award for their submissions.
