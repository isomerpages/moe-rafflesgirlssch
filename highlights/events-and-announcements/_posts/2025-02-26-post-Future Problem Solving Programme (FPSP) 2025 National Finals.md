<p>RGS hosted the Future Problem Solving Programme (FPSP) 2025 National Finals
once again at our Braddell Campus.</p>
<p>FPSP is an excellent platform for teaching problem-solving strategies
across the curriculum while fostering the development of 21st Century Competencies
in students.</p>

<p>Students compete in three divisions: Junior (Grades 4 to 6), Middle (Grades
7 to 9), and Senior (Grades 10 to 12), either in teams or individually.</p>
<p>Categories include Team Global Issues Problem Solving, Scenario Writing,
and the Community Problem Solving (CmPS) segment, where students identify
a real-world problem or area of concern within a community of their choosing
and develop solutions to address it.</p>
<p>Through a variety of educational challenges designed to empower curious
youth to become changemakers, the programme ignites curiosity about real-world
issues and equips participants with advanced problem-solving skills.</p>
<p>Congratulations to all the winners, and best wishes to the teams representing
Singapore at the International Conference at Indiana University Bloomington
in June 2025.</p>
