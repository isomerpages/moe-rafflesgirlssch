## English Language

The study of the English Language recognises that language is a communicative tool which transmits values and culture, and is a medium for the development of aesthetic sensibility. It enables the individual to make informed judgements about moral, philosophical and social issues, as well as to be an effective communicator in private and public discourse. Language develops an awareness of the self in relation to the diversity of human experience and it is a powerful tool for personal thought, expression and the development of thinkers, leaders and pioneers, as well as for advocacy.

Learning is not restricted to the classroom â€“ through visits to different spaces and school events, learning becomes more experiential and authentic.

Both staff and students participate enthusiastically in English/Literature-related activities, showing a school-wide approach to nurturing a love for the subject.

EL Week is an annual school event in RGS planned by the English Language and Literature Department for the students.
