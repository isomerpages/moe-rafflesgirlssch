## Membership

All parents/guardians of RGS students are automatically enrolled as ordinary members of PRGS from the time their daughters/wards become students of RGS. A one-time non-refundable membership fee of S$40.00 (which covers membership for all four years of your daughter’s/ward’s time in RGS) will be deducted by the school through GIRO in Term 1 of 2023. Where circumstances require, PRGS will, upon the school’s recommendation, waive this membership fee.

We hope that all parents/guardians of RGS students will see the value in being members of PRGS. However, should you wish to opt out of membership, please email [clorisa.loh@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg](mailto:clorisa.loh@rafflesgirlssch.edu.sg) for an opt-out form, which must be submitted by <u>**31 January 2023**.</u>
