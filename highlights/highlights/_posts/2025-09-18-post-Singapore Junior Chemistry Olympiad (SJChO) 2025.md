<p>We are especially proud of Wei Yifan (S310), who achieved the highest
overall score in the competition.</p>
<p>Introduced in 2010, SJChO is organised by the Singapore National Institute
of Chemistry (SNIC) in partnership with NUS, NTU, SUTD, IMRE, and ISCE²,
with support from the Ministry of Education. It provides a valuable platform
for upper secondary students to challenge themselves in their chemical
knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>Reflecting on her journey, Liu Xinyi (S412) shared:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“I started learning Chemistry completely from scratch at the end of Year 2, so climbing my way to H2 and H3-level knowledge for SJChO in a year, especially considering every other commitment a student has, was a journey definitely frequently wracked with frustration and difficulty. I would say, however, that the result created was far more than worth it: the learning of Chemistry has taught me volumes about the exact workings of the world, the value of understanding something to its most minute detail and how exactly to do so. More than anything, I’m even more grateful that I had the chance to fully enjoy the learning of Chemistry and truly appreciate every beauty it had to offer me.”</em>
