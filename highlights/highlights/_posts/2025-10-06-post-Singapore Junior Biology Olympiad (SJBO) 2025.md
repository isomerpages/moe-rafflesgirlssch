<h4>Student Reflection:</h4>
<p>SJBO was an unforgettable journey that allowed us not only to dive deeper
into biology beyond the school curriculum, but also to create lasting memories
together.
<br>
<br>Through the theory round, we were able to apply our critical thinking
skills and explore subjects beyond the usual syllabus; while the practical
round offered us a rare glimpse into marine biology, and the many conservation
efforts that Singapore has and informed us on the biodiversity in Singaporeâ€™s
waters.
<br>
<br>As a team, we quickly forged strong bonds, encouraging one another through
intense lab sessions, hours of theory revision, and the challenges of the
competition itself.
<br>
<br>We are truly grateful for the opportunity to explore biology outside the
classroom, learn more about Singapore's marine biology and for the unwavering
support and guidance of our teachers throughout the entire competition
season.</p>
