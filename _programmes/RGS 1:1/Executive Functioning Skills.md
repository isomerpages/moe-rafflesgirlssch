<p>In Term 1, our Year 1 girls hone their Executive Function Skills (EFS)—including
time management, prioritisation, and metacognition—through a series of
dynamic activities.</p>

<p>Stepping up as Sisters in Learning and Sisters at Heart, our senior girls
guide their juniors by sharing tips on learning apps and effective use
of iPads.</p>
<p>Through hands-on tasks and reflective debriefs, each girl celebrates her
achievements while identifying opportunities for growth. Beyond classroom
learning, EFS are essential life skills that empower our students to tackle
challenges with confidence.</p>
<p>May these seeds of executive function take root and flourish throughout
their RGS journey!</p>
