<p>We celebrated Earth Week with the theme Our Power, Our Planet — a powerful
reminder that our voices, choices, and actions can shape a greener, more
sustainable future.</p>
<p>The week began with a Hall Assembly led by Congress AT5, highlighting
the importance of sustainable living in honour of Earth Day. We were privileged
to hear from Ms Jane Goh, founder of RJ Paper, who shared how the paper
industry is embracing closed-loop systems and urged us to make conscious,
responsible choices in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>Students also took part in hands-on workshops organised by our CmPS and
SVIA groups — from crafting terrariums and shoebox aquariums to learning
about marine ecosystems, local produce, and the impact of fast fashion.
Booths by Project Seawing and Project Orbis added to the buzz with turtle
origami, a pop-up thrift store, and a donation drive.</p>
<p>A big thank you to Congress AT5 for their leadership, and to our CmPS
and SVIA teams for creatively championing eco-friendly practices through
such engaging experiences. We’re also grateful to our staff for their support
in guiding and encouraging these efforts. Let’s keep the momentum going
as we work together towards a more sustainable tomorrow.</p>
