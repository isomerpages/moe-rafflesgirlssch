## RGS Community Fair 2021

RGS Community Fair 2021 was held virtually on 20 October 2021. 

It serves as a great platform for the RGS community to learn from the various alumnae and current students, and to come together to acknowledge their efforts in serving different communities.

The theme for the Community Fair 2021 is ‘Different Stories, One Heartbeat - Serving Amidst COVID’. It encapsulates the idea that despite the constraints placed by COVID-19, it did not deter these presenters from their commitment to serve the community.

The programme was packed with inspiring stories from girls who ventured into service-learning and the priceless lessons and tips that they have gained from their journey. Do take a closer look at the following screenshots for some of the insightful content that they covered.

A plethora of topics such as food insecurity, migrant workers and working with people on the ground were covered enthusiastically by the presenters, and the RGS community was exposed to the tangible impacts that advocacy/service-learning can have on others around them! It was definitely a meaningful way to promote a culture of service to the school community
